Introduction:

  As the popularity of online sales continues to grow as a sales channel for most companies, so is the importance of using online marketing to help drive in-store sales as well. And while most companies are doing a great job of acquring and storing their customers' information (via rewards programs and email lists), most companies are having a tough time using that data from there. 
  In this study, we're going to be helping a bike shop owner to maximize their database for customers and transactions, to help focus their marketing efforts on the customer segments that is most profitable and drives the most sales. With the goal of identifying the most profitable bike lines and customer segments.
