## Project Overview
Stage 1: Research Question:
- Allowing a bike shop owner to understand what customer features they should focus on in order maximize the ROI of their marketing efforts when entering new markets - by analyzing transaction history, customer data, and adding other relevant datasets (i.e., weather). (Why)
- To uncover underlying trends in seasonal sales, product features and customer demograhics that are significantly correlated with positive purchasing behaviors (i.e., sales volumne, profit). (How)
- Allowing teams to understand: what customer features drive higher customer lifetime value (CLV), develop ideal numbers of customer profiles based on data, and predict customer lifetime value for new customers based on their demograhics. (What)

## Project Outline
Analyzing customer and transaction data to allow a bike shop owner to maximize their marketing ROI for going into new markets by:
- Identify which customer features drive purchases (i.e., age, wealth, city) and understand to what degree they influence purchases
- Determine how many customer profiles should be developed, along with identifying feature averages for each customer profile
- Calculate customer lifetime value (CLV) for current customers and predicting CLV of new customers based on their feature profile
