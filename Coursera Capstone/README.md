# Project Summary
Through a dataset provided by the US government, helping people who are potentially interested in moving to LA County to understand the sociodemographic make-up of its communities. Grouping cities based on common sociodemographic traits and developing benchmarks scores for each group. Along with developing visuals to easily compare cities and groups of cities.

## Project Goals
Analyzing and exploring LA County data to help a potential new Angelo help find the best spot to move to, based on their income and living standards:
- Analyzing and formatting data to visually explore how cities differ with sociodemographic scores
- Grouping cities from a data-driven perspective by using dimension reduction
- Developing sociodemographic benchmark and scores for each group of cities


## Introduction

With the national debt being at an all-time high for the US, having local levels of government become more efficent at managing funds could be a great opportunity for most cities -- with LA being a great case study. Seeing how Los Angeles County is very diverse and has the largest population for a county in the United States (larger then 41 states individually), there is a lot that can be learned from goverment policing and how socioecomonic standards can vary widely from city-to-city. Depending on what part of Los Angeles you happen to be in, you can go from the mecca of the entertainment history (Beverly Hills) to areas that resembles 2nd and 3rd world countries (Skid Row, South Central) in a quick 10-20 minute drive. This is sad to see because there is no shortage of sympathy and tax-payer funding [in California] for people who want to get their life back together, but sadly it seems that most resources aren't making significant contributions in battling houselessness and crime. A large part of the problem comes from not being able to efficiently prioritize public resources and zoning opportunities based on sociodemographic scores for each city. Given the size and complexity of LA County, one-size-fit-all approaches don't work, so instead we are going to use socioeconomic scores to create clusters of cities based on their data to help get a better understanding of LA. By grouping cities into clusters based on sociodemographic factors, this will allow city officiails to better study how some programs work well for one socioeconomic group and not the others (i.e., housing projects benefitting upper-class and lower-class vs hurting middle-class). 

## Methods

This study is going to be exploring a dataset of various cities within a specific area that includes various socioeconomic factors, by grouping them into different groups and creating different benchmarks for each group. We will be cluster cities into groups by using unsupervised machine learning methods. Once the data has been group accordingly, then we are going to mapping out the city cluster map of LA County to help identify potential visual trends (for future studies).

Initial data analysis started with an initial heatmap, to find sociodemographic variables that are similar and should be removed
