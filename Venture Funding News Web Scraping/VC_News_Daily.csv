""From being an investor in two dozen brands, the truth is more nuanced: some are really flourishing. Caraway had strong momentum at launch, with a clear vision from founder Jordan Nathan around the future of home goods. The COVID-19 pandemic then amplified that momentum with the surge of in-home cooking. Caraway's out of the gates growth rate is in the top 1% of what I've seen in DTC brands. This is not a pots and pans company, this is a disruptor to traditional brick and mortar multi-category home brands.""The $5.3M investment will transition Caraway from an early stage cookware startup, and accelerate the brand into a global lifestyle brand. With this latest round of funding, Caraway plans to expand their product line, offering a wider assortment of kitchen and home goods, keeping within the brand's core values around sustainability and non-toxic, better-for-you products.

Bright.md has raised $16.7 million in its oversubscribed Series C round co-led by B Capital, Seven Peaks Ventures and Concord Health Partners.Bright.md will use the funding for accelerated market and technology expansion of its suite of care-automation solutions, including their award-winning flagship product, SmartExam™, a capacity-boosting, AI-powered, asynchronous telehealth platform already deployed in leading hospitals and healthcare systems across the U.S. and Canada.""Our new strategic investors share Bright.md's vision to reimagine the way we deliver healthcare, especially in light of COVID-19,"" said Ray Costantini, M.D., co-founder and CEO of Bright.md. ""The pandemic has provoked a monumental shift in the care delivery and patient-provider experience. There's no turning back. Healthcare will begin at the virtual front door, making healthcare delivery more efficient and allowing patients to get better care and providers to deliver it virtually and expeditiously. The capital and insight from our partners will enable us to achieve greater scale more rapidly in this next phase of our growth. We will be able to support more hospital systems in delivering patient navigation, triage, and treatment of low-acuity conditions, while seamlessly escalating those with more serious conditions to a higher level of care. We've worked toward this for six years, and I am extremely proud of what the team has accomplished and the high-value strategic partners our progress has attracted.""The Next Frontier in Healthcare Begins at the Virtual Front DoorThe COVID-19 pandemic is shining a spotlight on the need for vibrant telehealth offerings. It has also exposed the limitations associated with video-only solutions. Though video has enabled patients and providers to continue care, video visits still require a scheduled appointment with a doctor, take weeks of provider training to become proficient, and take the same amount of physician time as in-person visits. Providers need to offer a virtual entrypoint to care, like Bright.md's SmartExam, which streamlines care delivery across the entire care continuum.SmartExam is the first step along the care pathway. Bright.md's AI-powered asynchronous virtual care platform enables patients to quickly share their concerns and symptoms with providers, get a diagnosis and treatment, or be fast-tracked for video, in-person, or specialty care. SmartExam acts like a virtual physician's assistant, automating 90% of a primary, urgent care, or video visit, and reducing average visit time from 20 minutes to under 90 seconds. By intelligently and automatically combining patient-intake data, interview information, electronic health records, and clinical-workflow integration, then creating and entering SOAP notes and structured data into the patient's health record, SmartExam boosts provider efficiency 15x and increases provider capacity to treat hundreds of patients in a single provider shift.""Providers across the country have witnessed a decline in ambulatory visits as a result of shelter-in-place orders. At the same time other systems are overrun with COVID-19  patients,"" Dr. Costantini said. ""In one region, clinicians are being furloughed and in other systems they are being pushed beyond capacity. SmartExam gives providers the necessary support they will need to help triage and treat, and offers patients a digital entrypoint to help them efficiently navigate the system in an environment where many fear doctor visits because of exposure to COVID-19. The coronavirus has only expedited a trend in care delivery that has been underway for nearly a decade.""In the first three months of 2020, Bright.md's healthcare delivery partners experienced more patient visits than during the 2019 calendar year, and supported evaluation of more than 100,000 COVID-related patient visits. The company currently works with some of the largest health systems to deliver treatment for nearly 500 conditions such as the flu, pediatrics, dermatology, muscular-skeletal, and behavioral health issues. Bright.md integrated coronavirus screening questions into its care platform in January, and began offering a free screening tool to hospitals in early March.What Investors Are Saying About Bright.mdJames Olsen, Founder &  Managing Partner, Concord Health Partners""We strive to identify and support best-in-class healthcare companies with innovative solutions that address affordability, quality and access to care with meaningful strategic benefits for health systems. Bright.md aligns with our strategy with a proven platform that enables health systems to leverage their existing physicians to meaningfully increase capacity and streamline care delivery through AI powered automation.

Stork Club provides services to thousands of employees from companies in the healthcare, finance, and technology sectors.",Seed,"$2,700,000",28 May 2020,Stork Club Pulls In $2.7M Seed Round,https://vcnewsdaily.com/stork-club/venture-capital-funding/qyjjvgkmyf,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Stork Club has secured $2.7 million in a seed financing round.",San Francisco,CA,https://vcnewsdaily.com/Stork%20Club/venture-funding.php,"Today, Stork Club unveils its comprehensive maternity care platform with the goal of modernizing maternity healthcare to deliver better health outcomes, tackling a $130 billion market. It is also announcing $2.7M in seed funding from Bowery Capital, Slow Ventures and angels Arianna Simpson (Partner at Andreessen Horowitz), Kevin Mahaffey (Co-founder of Lookout) and others. Loren Straub from Bowery Capital is joining the board. Stork Club will use the investment to expand its go-to-market capabilities and bring more inclusive maternity care coverage to enterprises.Stork Club is the only enterprise solution consolidating all aspects of fertility and maternity care into one concierge-like experience resulting in better outcomes, while drastically reducing employers' healthcare costs. Unlike a perk or another app, Stork Club extends traditional healthcare coverage to historically overlooked, yet critical components of maternal health: diagnostics, egg and sperm freezing, IVF, surrogacy, adoption, childbirth with doulas and breastfeeding support. For a company with a few thousand employees, Stork Club can save up to $3 million dollars per year. Already providing services to thousands of employees from companies in the healthcare, finance, and technology sectors, Stork Club helps companies retain and attract top diverse talent, and help employees build families. The current health crisis proves our healthcare system is failing women, despite a rise in the expense. After payroll, health insurance is the second largest expense for an organization, costing over $1 trillion per year, and growing. Within insurance, maternity care is the largest expense, which costs companies $130 billion a year. Outdated, the healthcare model does not promote gender equity, LGTBQ+ families, or include support beyond pregnancy care. ""Maternity care was designed 50 years ago for a young, heterosexual family where the mother stayed home. That's not today's family,"" said Jeni Mayorskaya, CEO and founder of Stork Club. ""Stork Club modernizes care for families by integrating all maternity care into a simple, inclusive solution. By partnering with top providers directly and providing a continuity of care, we give people the freedom to have a family on their terms, guide them to better outcomes, and help businesses save millions of dollars per year.""""Healthcare is a cost problem for businesses, so much so, businesses are looking for alternatives. Businesses are shifting towards directly sourcing healthcare to reduce costs, and maternity care is one of their top priorities,"" said Loren Straub, principal at Bowery Capital. ""Stork Club solves the cost problem while simultaneously helping businesses retain top talent and create a more inclusive and diverse workplace.""The Stork Club platform provides a continuity of care, treating every component of maternity care as together, not in siloes, like it's currently done. It begins with access to the best doctors and coverage for treatments and medications and continues with unlimited support on each stage of the family journey: preconception, pregnancy, postpartum and newborn care. ""There is a lot of capital being put into rethinking our healthcare system as the value of healthcare has gone down. Premiums continue to rise, but there has not been a commiserate rise in the quality of care,"" said Will Quist, partner at Slow Ventures. ""Within maternity care, a lot of the focus has been on improving acute treatments. What is compelling about Stork Club is that they are looking at maternity care holistically. Providing best-in-class access to IVF is important and can deliver better results at a lower cost, but Stork Club is asking 'have we done everything we can to avoid IVF altogether?'. Building a solution aimed at addressing the entire maternity journey has the potential to deliver the best outcomes at the lowest cost.""How Stork Club WorksEmployers add Stork Club to their health plan to provide coverage for fertility and certain aspects of maternity care. Covered employees and their dependents access Stork Club desktop and mobile apps to get recommendations and care relevant to their current family goals: whether they plan to have a child later, now, are already expecting or returning back to work.Stork Club partners with top medical providers across the US directly and incentivizes them for better outcomes through direct contracting. All members have access to vetted certified telehealth experts, as well as transparent payments integrated with their existing health plan.

The round was led by existing investor Georgian Partners, who recently raised Canada's first $1-billion-plus private-sector venture capital fund. Current Bluecore investors FirstMark and Norwest also invested in the round. This new investment brings Bluecore's total funding to date to more than $100 million.Funding to Accelerate AI Capabilities for Digital Sales ChannelsThe company will use the funds to accelerate its work in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Over the last four years, Bluecore has developed and released the industry's first fully automated email marketing solution. Its current AI applications are able to auto-generate completely personalized email campaigns by curating products, content, and offers, specific to each shopper a brand interacts with. This shopper-specific personalization is based on a trifecta of insights unique to Bluecore's data model: 1) consumer identity, 2) shopper behavior, and 3) real-time changes to retailers' product catalogues.Bluecore's AI additionally responds autonomously to implicit consumer feedback on, and preferences around, frequency and type of communications shoppers want to receive from retail brands. Its artificial marketing solutions have seen rapid adoption by retailers, with over 70% of clients, including Jockey, Lane Bryant and Hammacher Schlemmer, now deploying its current AI. In 2019, Bluecore migrated to a completely success-driven pricing model, where clients pay solely based on traffic and conversions generated by the AI.These successes have motivated Bluecore to accelerate the development of more advanced AI applications, built upon the predictive models it is known for. Over the next 12 months, Bluecore will unveil new capabilities, such as the ability to use what it learns about product trends across more than 400 hundred brands' live product catalogs to improve experiences on an individual retailer's digital channels. Informed by 100B+ consumer interactions and 200M+ products, the new AI application will learn and predict which product is most likely to drive a purchase by a specific individual. It will then autonomously trigger the next-best action for a given shopper, no matter where he or she is shopping in the moment.""We're eager to bring a new form of real-time intelligence that no one else has been able to tap into, to market,"" said Fayez Mohamood, CEO of Bluecore. ""We're both encouraged and emboldened by the fact that our investors have continuously backed our AI and substantially increased their investments in us. Having accelerated our growth and achieved best-in-class sales productivity metrics for clients, the next phase in our partnership with Georgian Partners, FirstMark and Norwest will be critical to realizing an even greater vision for the retail industry.""Moving the Retail Industry from Third-Party to First-Party InsightsBluecore estimates that it currently influences approximately 10% of all non-Amazon Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) in the U.S. It plans to increase this percentage through its use of AI to transform retail brands' existing first-party data into a more precise and immediately actionable form of consumer insight as the industry distances itself from third-party cookies. Georgian Partners' repeat investment in the company is validation of this vision and a nod to Bluecore's growth since the Toronto-based VC's initial Series B investment in 2015.Georgian Partners invests in growth-stage software companies that apply disruptive and emerging technologies--such as artificial intelligence, conversational AI and trust--to mainstream business challenges. It currently has a diverse portfolio of 38 active companies, including True Fit, WorkFusion, and Top Hat, with a wide range of successful exits including Shopify, OpCity and PrecisionLeader.""Bluecore is uniquely equipped to deliver the advanced artificial intelligence capabilities that retailers need to navigate rapidly changing market conditions,"" said Tyson Baber, Partner, Georgian Partners. ""We are delighted to be deepening our partnership with Bluecore with this funding round, as well as continuing our long-standing research and development partnership. Their work is helping brands get actionable intelligence from one of the richest sets of retail industry data in the world.""Investing in the Performance of Its DecisionsBluecore describes its general investment area as not only in AI, but as the overall improvement of the performance of its decisions. Some of its investments will include introducing more advanced methods of model training, such as federated or transfer learning technologies, which would enable Bluecore's models to aggregate learnings across its network without sharing client data.Retail brands are increasingly prioritizing retention of their existing customers and looking for new ways to leverage their owned, first-party data--rather than that of third-party sources--to define and capture new audiences. Bluecore's growing partnership with Google Cloud and increased focus on consent-based, first-party customer IDs will ultimately introduce a more transparent model than those based on third-party cookies.About BluecoreBluecore is a marketing technology company that's reimagining how the world's fastest growing retail brands transform casual shoppers into lifetime customers. Through its patented retail data model and the recent release of Bluecore Communicate™ and Bluecore Site™, brands are now able to personalize 100% of communications delivered to consumers through their email and ecommerce shopping experiences.

Apeel Sciences,"Apeel Sciences is a company that's fighting the global food waste crisis by utilizing nature's tools to prevent waste in the first place - a sustainable approach to the world's growing food demands. The company's plant-derived technology helps USDA Organic Certified and conventional fresh food growers, suppliers, and retailers improve produce quality and extend shelf life, which minimizes food waste from the farm to the retail shelf to the kitchen. Apeel Sciences was founded in 2012 with a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to help reduce post harvest food loss in developing countries that lack access to refrigeration infrastructure (i.e., a cold chain). Today, Apeel formulations have been proven effective at reducing the rate of spoilage for dozens of USDA Organic Certified and conventional produce categories, and the company works with partners ranging from smallholder farmers and local organic growers to the world's largest food brands and retailers.",Venture,"$250,000,000",26 May 2020,Apeel Sciences Scoops Up $250M,https://vcnewsdaily.com/apeel-sciences/venture-capital-funding/tfmgfmtvkf,"SANTA BARBARA, CA, Apeel Sciences today announced $250M in new financing.",Santa Barbara,CA,https://vcnewsdaily.com/Apeel%20Sciences/venture-funding.php,"Apeel Sciences, a World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer and recognized among TIME Magazine's Best Inventions and Fast Company's World Changing Ideas, today announced $250M in new financing. GIC led the most current capital raise, and with previous investment from Oprah Winfrey in 2019 and others, it brings the company's valuation to over one billion dollars. The new financing will enable the company to continue tackling the food waste problem on the global level. In 2020, Apeel is on track to save 20 million pieces of fruit from going to waste at retail stores, while also extending shelf-life in the home where food waste rates are three times as high.Apeel is on a mission to combat food waste by using its plant-derived solution to add a little extra ""peel"" to the surface of fruits and vegetables, doubling to tripling the shelf life of many produce types without the need for refrigeration. An updated report by Project Drawdown recently identified the reduction of food waste as the number one solution to address climate change based on the greenhouse gases emitted from both the production of food and having it ultimately decompose in a landfill.Apeel dramatically reduces food waste throughout almost every step of the supply chain - from packer to retailer and ultimately to consumers at home - thereby increasing the efficiency of Earth's resources required to feed a global population. While driving value for U.S. and European produce suppliers and retailers will remain a top priority, Apeel's funding also ensures greater support of the company's initiatives in economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America that are at greater risk of food security issues and food waste. ""We are proud to team up with GIC to help create a better future with less waste,"" said James Rogers, Founder and CEO of Apeel Sciences. ""Food waste is an invisible tax imposed on everyone that participates in the food system. Eliminating global food waste can free up $2.6 trillion annually1, allowing us to make the food ecosystem better for growers, distributors, retailers, consumers and our planet. Together, we're putting time back on the industry's side to help deal with the food waste crisis and the challenges it poses to food businesses.""Additional participating investors in the company's recent capital raise include Viking Global Investors, Upfront Ventures, Tao Capital Partners and Rock Creek Group. Santa Barbara locals Oprah Winfrey and Katy Perry have also joined the effort as minority, non-participatory investors to support the company's mission in making sustainable food systems a reality for all. ""I hate to see food wasted, when there are so many people in the world who are going without,"" said Winfrey. ""Apeel can extend the life of fresh produce, which is critical to our food supply and our planet too.""To date, Apeel Sciences has achieved several major commercialization milestones with the top food retailers in the United States and Europe. On average, U.S. retailers that use Apeel have experienced a 50% reduction in shrink, a 5-10% growth in dollar sales, and an incremental 10% growth in dollar sales when sold in conjunction with in-store marketing campaigns. Apeel's food waste reduction results underscore the industry's growing commitment to reducing waste and consumer demand for quality fresh produce that leads to less food waste at home.In recent weeks, COVID-19 and its vast personal and economic impact have caused major disruptions in the food supply chain. Understanding the resources and functions required to grow, produce and move food through the system has made the need to safeguard our precious food supply more apparent than ever. The current food system is calibrated so closely to past supply and demand expectations and the exact perishability of fresh produce that when the system is stretched, the system breaks. By introducing more time, access and freshness across the supply chain, Apeel's technology extends value and increases operational flexibility for suppliers and retailers. Additionally, shoppers who are more cognizant of their own personal food supply can bring home high quality produce with a longer window to enjoy it.ABOUT APEEL PRODUCEFrom strawberries to peppers, every fruit and vegetable has a protective peel or skin that nature uses to keep it fresh. Made from materials found in fruit, Apeel adds a little extra ""peel"" to the surface of fresh produce to slow water loss and oxidation (two factors that cause spoilage). Apeel produce stays fresh for much longer, so you have more time to enjoy it at its most delicious - and much less food and money is wasted. For suppliers and retailers, Apeel's technology creates an optimal microclimate inside every fruit or vegetable, maintaining quality while extending shelf life and transportability - with reduced reliance on refrigeration and controlled atmosphere.

Monte Rosa was launched from Ridgeline, Versant's Discovery Engine based in the Basel Technology Park. The company is now headquartered in Boston, MA, with research operations in both Boston and Basel, Switzerland.Monte Rosa has developed a platform to rationally design small molecules that reprogram ubiquitin ligases to eliminate disease drivers previously deemed undruggable. The platform includes computational capabilities to predict and model ligase-neosubstrate interactions and quantitative proteomics to obtain protein degradation profiles.Expanding the horizon for cereblon reprogrammingIn 2018, Monte Rosa was established in Versant's Ridgeline laboratories in collaboration with The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and Cancer Research UK. Academic co-founders Rajesh Chopra, MD, and Ian Collins, PhD, are prominent leaders in the field of protein degradation.Nicolas Thoma, PhD, a world-leading chemical and structural biologist at the Friedrich Miescher Institute in Basel, also joined Monte Rosa as scientific advisor. Dr. Thoma recently published a series of seminal papers revealing mechanistic details of cereblon-mediated protein degradation. His work demonstrated the pivotal role of a glycine loop degron on target proteins, and opened up the potential for drug discovery on many more disease-relevant targets. This work underpins Monte Rosa's platform and approach.""With our improved understanding of the broad potential of cereblon and other ubiquitin ligases, there is now an opportunity to eliminate major - and currently undruggable - drivers of solid tumors such as transcription factors and adaptor proteins,"" said Markus Warmuth, MD, CEO of Monte Rosa and a venture partner at Versant.Developing drug candidates with novel degradation profilesMonte Rosa has built an integrated drug discovery platform that combines one of the most diverse chemical libraries of protein degraders with in-house proteomics and structural biology capabilities. By the end of 2020, the chemical library is expected to grow to more than 10,000 structures designed for ubiquitin ligase reprogramming.To date, several validated small molecule leads have been identified through conventional and phenotypic screens along with rational drug design. A number of these leads possess novel degradation profiles and have demonstrated in vivo efficacy across several different tumor models.""Using this approach we can potentially design drugs for the hundreds to thousands of proteins with glycine loop degrons,"" said Alex Mayweg, PhD, managing director at Versant and Monte Rosa board member. ""Unlike protacs, these small molecules can degrade proteins that lack classical drug-binding pockets, which include known drivers of certain forms of cancer and other serious diseases.""Operating and financing plansMonte Rosa plans to build out its platform and concurrently develop a portfolio of drug candidates for multiple indications. One of its portfolio leads, MRT-048, has demonstrated a differentiated degradation profile and promising in vivo activity in several models of resistant breast cancer. The molecule is undergoing further preclinical development and safety testing. The company expects to file one or more IND submissions during 2021.""Monte Rosa has built a formidable drug discovery capability and portfolio based on access to unique insights into ubiquitin ligase reprogramming,"" said Ali Behbahani, MD, general partner at NEA and Monte Rosa board member. ""This approach is now demonstrating the potential to impact patients with intractable forms of cancer.""The company will soon launch a Series B financing to back the development of multiple clinical-stage programs.

They have raised $7.5 million in a seed round led by Foundation Capital and joined by former GE CEO Jeff Immelt, insurance giant Mitsui's MSAD venture firm, and former AthenaHealth CEO Jonathan Bush.Just like companies like Twilio and Stripe radically simplified complex piecemeal solutions in telephony and payments with a simple API, Skyflow allows companies with sensitive data (PII, PCI or PHI) to manage, access, and govern with a small set of API calls.Despite the growing number of cybersecurity offerings, we continue to see data breaches of customers' social security numbers, credit card data, and even their health data. Even with a spate of new laws, from GDPR to CCPA, built to motivate companies to do the right thing for consumers, companies continue to abide only by the letter of security compliance, rather than by its true spirit.Skyflow was founded by Anshu Sharma and Prakash Khot, both former Salesforce executives and tech founders. They have already attracted a team of over 20 engineers and industry-leading experts in encryption, database technology, key management, cloud security, tokenization, and homomorphic encryption from Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle, and PayPal, Cohesity, among others.""Anshu and Prakash recognized the power and potential of the cloud while we were all at Salesforce,"" said Todd McKinnon, CEO of Okta. ""Every business needs to be digital to compete, and trust has become so core to building a brand. Digital privacy along with identity and security will only become more important as organizations evolve and grow online.""""We started Skyflow because we were inspired by what companies like Apple, Google, Netflix and others were doing to rewire their systems to prevent data breaches,"" said Anshu Sharma Co-founder & CEO of Skyflow, ""Unlike most payment systems, Apple Pay doesn't even ever store or use your real credit card number even when you make a payment. Skyflow has taken a similar approach to all the sensitive data so companies can run their workflows, analytics and machine learning to serve the customer, but do so without exposing the data as a result of a potential theft or breach. Recent breakthroughs in encryption and new hardware technologies like Intel SGX have allowed us to build something that was a distant dream for most even a few years ago.""About SkyflowFounded in 2019, Skyflow builds privacy APIs powered by a customer data vault.

Today, Day One unveils its team, $60M Series A financing, and announces its first promising clinical-stage oncology treatment, which Day One acquired through Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.Advances in cancer research enable drug developers to identify children and adults who may benefit from the same medicine. Yet, children with cancer continue to be left behind. ""In the US, children with cancer first gain access to cutting-edge investigational treatments an average of 6.5 years later than adults. This disparity in access occurs for multiple reasons, including the prioritization of adult cancers that can create larger markets; a development model that remains centered on adult conditions versus mechanism of action; and outdated assumptions around trial feasibility in pediatric oncology. As a result, only 10 new drugs for pediatric cancer have been FDA approved over the last 30 years,"" explained Dr. Samuel Blackman, co-founder, pediatric oncologist, and Chief Medical Officer of Day One. ""Our goal is to dramatically change the pace of new cancer drug development for children by identifying and developing novel therapies based on pediatric cancer biology, and then following the biology to the benefit of all patients whether they are children or adults.""Enabled by advances in the understanding of the biology of childhood cancers, and informed by its network of leading pediatric oncologists, Day One is equipped to identify patients across the age spectrum who are likely to benefit from a new treatment based upon their tumor's biology.

""Cancer impacts patients of all ages. New treatments should, too,"" noted Julie Grant, acting-CEO at Day One and General Partner at Canaan. ""At Day One we ask - what is the fastest path to FDA approval and insurance coverage for this product? Treating patients whose tumors are most likely to respond to treatment, irrespective of age, as quickly as possible is a simple and often underutilized strategy.

Over 250 patients have received DAY101 in clinical trials thus far. DAY101 demonstrated early clinical activity across adult and pediatric populations with specific genetic alterations in the RAS/MAP kinase pathway. Details of the clinical safety and efficacy data will be announced in 2020 and 2021.Tumors harboring genetic alterations, such as BRAF wildtype fusions, BRAF mutations, and other alterations in the MAPK pathway could be addressed by DAY101. Many of these populations cannot be adequately treated with incumbent BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Michael Gladstone, Principal at Atlas Venture, said ""Targeted oncology therapies in the RAS/MAP kinase pathway can deliver tremendous benefit to patients young and old. Our priority is developing DAY101 as both a monotherapy and in combination with complementary therapies to treat a range of aggressive cancers that are not served by existing drugs.""

CLARA will use the funds to extend its product suite, attract critical industry talent, and expand its global reach.CLARA analytics uses both structured and unstructured data to unlock relevant seeds of knowledge from medical notes, bills, and other documents and bring them into a cross-industry data lake to generate valuable predictions and other insights for claims teams. CLARA's suite of AI-based software, which includes CLARA claims, CLARA providers, CLARA litigation as well as its popular Medicare Set-Aside solution, is used by some of the world's leading insurers, including Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies, EMC Insurance, Amerisure, and QBE Insurance.""We are reshaping the entire claims process by analyzing millions of data points and generating meaningful and actionable insights in a matter of seconds,"" says CLARA analytics CEO Gary Hagmueller. ""With this funding, we're excited to expand our team and extend into new product areas and markets and to have Aspen Capital Group as a new investor on that journey.""CLARA is rapidly growing by saving insurers and employers millions of dollars in workers compensation claims. A share of those claims starts out routinely but rapidly increases in cost and severity due to unexpected medical and legal expenses. CLARA's products use AI to accurately identify these hard-to-detect claims much earlier and more effectively than conventional techniques. CLARA's providers solution optimizes medical networks and helps find the right doctors for each claim. CLARA litigation recommends optimal litigation and settlement strategies to meaningfully reduce costs. CLARA's Medicare Set-Aside solution instantly compiles and updates MSA reports. The products are designed to integrate and, when used together, drive compound benefits. One insurer using claims and providers, for example, has seen claimants return to work 35% faster in claims processed using CLARA.The new financing is ideally timed, as COVID-19-related disruptions have generated rising interest in CLARA's approach. Insurers are looking for new tools and additional data to navigate rapid changes in claims, litigation, and health care delivery, which the National Council on Compensation Insurance estimates could add upwards of $81.5 billion to the cost of workers compensation claims across the 38 states on which it tracks data. By leveraging CLARA's cross-industry data lake and AI capabilities, organizations gain instant access to deeper data and insights, so they can make faster, more calculated decisions that adapt to today's changing conditions. Adjusters, for example, can identify claims where medical notes don't include a COVID diagnostic code but reference terms such as ""shortness of breath"" and ""fever"" for claimants based in locations with high infection rates and engage the right specialist on their team to ensure those claims are handled in a prescribed way.To meet surging interest, CLARA will invest heavily in customer-facing sales and support teams and augment existing expertise in workers compensation. The company is also growing its product team and expanding into additional lines of property and casualty insurance. Rising health care and litigation expenses are driving up claim costs and putting pressure on margins across the P&C industry.

Valor Equity Partners led the funding with participation from Felicis Ventures, Greyhound Capital, and Coalition's existing investors.The investment comes as the company's customer base crosses 25,000 - a 600% increase from the prior year - making it one of the largest providers of cyber insurance and security in the United States. Coalition's unique product offerings combine best-in-class insurance and proactive cybersecurity tools to help keep businesses safe. Cyber losses cost the global economy upwards of $1.5 trillion each year, and yet the majority of businesses are under-insured and under-prepared to manage and mitigate the risks of an increasingly digital world. Coalition is addressing this gap by providing no-cost cybersecurity tools to prevent losses, security and incident response services to contain them, and comprehensive cyber insurance to help organizations recover from failures and breaches.""Cybersecurity isn't a technology problem, it's a risk management problem,"" said Joshua Motta, Founder and CEO of Coalition. ""Traditional cybersecurity technology such as firewalls and antivirus were designed to protect networks, not businesses. Coalition protects an entire business by offering cybersecurity-as-a-service without any additional hardware or software, security and incident response services, and comprehensive insurance cover of up to $15 million.""The announced funding will help Coalition target three key areas:Cybersecurity Access: once accessible only to national governments and large enterprises, Coalition will continue to make available, at no cost, state-of-the-art cybersecurity capabilities to small and midsize businesses. Coalition's small and midsize policyholders experienced claims that cost an average of $160,000 - an expense that few businesses can afford to bear. ""Businesses need more protection than traditional insurers can offer, including help preventing incidents from happening in the first place, and support during and after a crisis,"" said Vivek Pattipati, Partner at Valor Equity Partners. ""We believe Coalition will be as disruptive to the cybersecurity industry as it has been to the insurance industry.""International expansion: cyber risks know no boundaries, and Coalition plans to make its offerings available globally starting with Canada. ""As the entire world becomes increasingly digital, Coalition has a tremendous opportunity to address the real risks that cyber poses across many markets,"" said Pogos Saiadian, Partner at Greyhound Capital.New Products: Coalition plans to develop additional insurance products to address a new range of threats technology brings to both tangible and intangible assets - many of which are not well covered by traditional insurance policies.

Amplyx Pharmaceuticals,"Amplyx Pharmaceuticals is developing novel, broad-spectrum antifungal agents for the treatment of life-threatening fungal infections. The company's lead compound, APX001, will enter clinical development in 2016 and has shown broad-spectrum activity in animal models of invasive fungal infection by common species of Candida and Aspergillus, as well as high potency against rare, difficult-to-treat molds. Amplyx has raised $42.5 million in venture capital and received more than $10 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health to supports its drug discovery and development efforts.

The financing was led by Sofinnova Investments, with participation from existing investors including New Enterprise Associates, Lundbeckfonden Ventures, Arix Bioscience, Pappas Capital, RiverVest Venture Partners, 3Ã-5 Partners and BioMed Ventures. New equity investment from Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Adage Capital Management completed the financing round. Amplyx will use the proceeds of the financing to advance the clinical development of the company's product candidates, fosmanogepix and MAU868.""The current pandemic highlights the continued need for the development of safe and effective antimicrobial agents able to address emerging threats. This impressive syndicate of investors shares Amplyx's commitment to bringing life-saving, innovative medicines to patients with compromised immune systems,"" said Ciara Kennedy, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Amplyx. ""This financing enables us to build on positive initial data for our lead program, fosmanogepix, in invasive candidemia, and expand to proof of concept studies in other invasive and difficult-to-treat fungal infections, including invasive aspergillosis. In addition, we continue to advance MAU868, our monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of clinically significant BKV infection in people who have received either a kidney or hematopoietic cell transplant.""Annaliesa Anderson, Ph.D., FAAM, vice president and chief scientific officer, bacterial vaccines and hospital, Pfizer, added, ""It is important that the growing threat of current and emerging treatment-resistant fungal pathogens is met by research and development efforts that deliver new treatment options for patients with invasive fungal infections. We look forward to supporting Amplyx as they work to develop therapies with a novel approach.""About FosmanogepixFosmanogepix is a novel broad-spectrum antifungal agent being evaluated in clinical trials in patients with life-threatening fungal infections. Enrollment was recently completed in a Phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the intravenous and oral formulations of fosmanogepix for the treatment of patients with Candida infections. In that study, fosmanogepix demonstrated a high level of treatment success in the first 10 patients treated. Additional Phase 2 studies of fosmanogepix are ongoing in patients with Aspergillus and other mold infections, as well as infections caused by multi-drug-resistant Candida auris, a life-threatening fungal infection recently characterized as an ""urgent"" threat by the Centers for Disease Control.Fosmanogepix has a novel mechanism of action, and its active moiety has shown broad-spectrum activity against common species of Candida and Aspergillus, including multi-drug- resistant strains such as C. auris and C. glabrata, as well as rare hard-to-treat molds including Fusarium, Scedosporium and some fungi from the Mucorales order. Invasive fungal infections result in high mortality rates (30-80%) despite standard-of-care treatment. The frequency of fungi resistant to both the azole and echinocandin classes of drugs is increasing and there is a significant unmet medical need for a new broad-spectrum antifungal.Fosmanogepix has received Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for seven separate indications, and is designated as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for the treatment of four indications.About MAU868MAU868, a potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody with activity against BK virus (BKV), is entering Phase 2 development for the prevention or treatment of devastating and often life-threatening diseases associated with BKV infection in transplant patients. MAU868 neutralizes all four genotypes of BKV at sub-nanomolar concentrations and has a high barrier to resistance in vitro. Reactivation of BKV, which is present and usually remains latent in 80 to 90% of the population, can occur following immunosuppression in patients who have undergone kidney or hematopoietic cell transplantation. BKV disease can lead to devastating and costly consequences, such as nephropathy and rejection that primarily affect kidney transplant recipients, and hemorrhagic cystitis that affects hematopoietic cell transplant recipients.About Amplyx PharmaceuticalsAmplyx Pharmaceuticals is developing innovative therapies for patients with compromised immune systems, including cancer and transplant patients, and the critically ill. The company's two lead products are fosmanogepix (APX001), for the treatment of life-threatening fungal infections caused by pathogens such as Candida, Aspergillus and rare molds, and MAU868, a monoclonal antibody that potently neutralizes the BK virus, which can cause significant morbidity and mortality in transplant patients.

RLYB211 is a plasma-derived hyperimmune globulin in development for the prevention of FNAIT.FNAIT is a disorder that can occur during pregnancy and is caused by an incompatibility between mother and fetus of a specific human platelet antigen (HPA), most commonly HPA-1. This incompatibility can cause a pregnant woman to develop antibodies that attack the platelets of her fetus. The destruction of platelets in the fetus can result in severe thrombocytopenia in the baby, potentially leading to intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The consequences of ICH can be devastating, and include miscarriage of the fetus, loss of the newborn, or severe lifelong neurological disability in those babies who survive.RLYB211 is designed to prevent FNAIT through a mechanism known as antibody-mediated immune suppression (AMIS). There is currently no approved therapy for the prevention or treatment of FNAIT.Rallybio acquired RLYB211 from Prophylix AS.

Founded in 2018 and backed by Adams Street Partners and others, Homeward is expanding rapidly in Texas, Georgia and Colorado, with plans to offer it's solution to agents and home buyers nationwide.",Debt and Equity Financing,"$105,000,000",14 May 2020,Homeward Lands $105M,https://vcnewsdaily.com/homeward/venture-capital-funding/krzdnpkkvv,"AUSTIN, TX, Homeward today announced it has secured growth capital of $105M, including $20M in equity and $85M in debt.",Austin,TX,https://vcnewsdaily.com/Homeward/venture-funding.php,"The $20M of equity financing was led by Adams Street Partners, with additional participation by Javelin Venture Partners and LiveOak Venture Partners. The $85M in debt was secured from multiple institutional lenders.The new funding will allow Homeward to purchase more homes for its customers, and expand its agent partnerships.""Despite COVID-related volatility, we've continued to see strong customer and agent demand for our offering. Housing inventory is low right now, but demand remains high and customers are using our non-contingent cash offers to beat out other bidders,"" said Tim Heyl, founder and CEO at Homeward.Jeffrey Diehl, Adam Street's Managing Partner and Head of Investments, will join the board. Jeff led an early investment in BoomTown, one of the leading CRM solutions for real estate agents, and the investment in Homeward is consistent with Adam Street's focus to target resilient companies that need capital to fuel growth.""We are a selective investor, particularly in the current environment, but Homeward stood out,"" said Jeffrey Diehl. ""The company is growing rapidly, has strong leaders with deep industry experience, and has impressive traction with agent partners.""Also participating in the round is Jed Katz, Managing Director of Javelin Venture Partners and formerly a Founder of Move.com and Rent.Net.""Homeward solves a long-term pain point for Realtors and their clients by making offers more competitive and home sales more certain,"" said Jed Katz. ""We think they have an A+ team and a solid model that's well positioned to scale in a way the industry and the capital markets will embrace.""Putting agents back in the center of real estate transaction innovationTim Heyl founded Homeward to empower modern real estate agents. Tim is one of the country's top agents, has sold over 3,500 homes, and founded the Heyl Group in 2009, which has grown to become one of the top 25 agent teams in the country.""Most technology companies have come from outside the real estate space and have tried to cut the agent out,"" said Heyl. ""We're taking a much different approach. We empower agents with institutional capital so they can enable their clients to buy before they sell.""43% of home buyers have an existing home they need to sell before they buy their next one. This hurdle can cause homeowners to delay their move indefinitely, which hurts both customers and their agents.To solve this problem, Homeward works with agents to get their clients approved to make a Homeward all-cash offer. Agents go directly to Homeward's site and can register their client in less than a minute. Homeward then works to approve their client to make an all-cash offer.The company will be expanding its relationships with top agents in the three states it operates in: Texas, Colorado, and Georgia. In coming years, the company plans to open its offering to agents nationwide.""Homeward is built by a top agent who's trying to empower us and not cut us out,"" said Lane Hornung, Founder & CEO of 8z Real Estate. ""Homeward understands the role agents should play in the transaction and that's why we partnered with them. We use Homeward as a secret weapon to help win new clients and close contingent buyers a lot faster than we could before.""""Working with Homeward, my clients got approved and made a winning offer within days,"" said Grant Rothberg, a top real estate agent in Houston. ""They were able to move into their new home first, then take their time to sell their old home, ultimately earning them $40,000 more than low-ball iBuyer offers.""Redesigning the home buying experienceThe Homeward Way is the company's core offering. It gives homebuyers credit for their home equity up front, and lets them make an all-cash offer to secure their next home using the company's funds. Homeward customers also receive a floor price guarantee on their existing home in case they're unable to sell it for its full market value. Buyers that use Homeward's all-cash offer get an average discount of 2 - 5% on their next home and are twice as likely to beat buyers who make mortgage-backed offers. Homeward customers  can also stay in their current home while they make improvements to their new property. They only move once and can control the timing of their move.Homeward customers don't have to sell their existing homes at a discount to iBuyers, which typically offer below market pricing and charge fees greater than those of traditional real estate agents. The service charge for Homeward is transparent, between 2 - 3% of the purchase price depending on the home's size and location, compared to iBuyers who charge up to 9% of the home sale price. iBuyers also take a portion of the real estate agent's commission, and in some cases force the home buyer to work exclusively with their agent.The Homeward Way:1 - Get approved: Submit an online application and Homeward will calculate your home equity and provide you with an approval in minutes.2 - Make an all-cash offer with Homeward's funds: Secure your next home by making an all-cash offer with Homeward's funds.3 - Rent your new home from Homeward: Move into your new home and rent it from Homeward for up to six months while you finish selling your existing home.4 - Sell your existing home: List your home for sale when you're ready. If it doesn't sell, Homeward will buy it from you at a pre-agreed, fair market price.5 - Get a mortgage and close on your new home: As soon as your old home sells, buy your new one back from Homeward at the original price, plus a 2 - 3% convenience fee.About HomewardHomeward lets customers relax, and buy before they sell.

She created Mos for one mission: Using technology to help citizens access their fundamental rights. Today, Mos's platform checks over 30,000 eligibility criteria for students who fill out their application, and matches them with a personal financial aid advisor to ensure they've gotten as much aid as possible. Already, it's been used by 200,000 students and their families. Mos, founded in 2017 is backed by Sequoia Capital and Arrive, a Roc Nation Company.",Series A,"$13,000,000",14 May 2020,Mos Secures $13M in Series A,https://vcnewsdaily.com/mos/venture-capital-funding/mxfvwhdnmr,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Mos announces $13M in Series A funding led by Sequoia Capital.",San Francisco,CA,https://vcnewsdaily.com/Mos/venture-funding.php,"Mos, the startup that helps students get more college aid, today is announcing their Series A funding and launching a comprehensive guide for students navigating financial aid, tuition costs, and housing constraints during the COVID-19 crisis. Student debt in the US has skyrocketed to a staggering $1.5 trillion, and every year, more than a million students don't apply for financial aid even though they'd qualify for it. Amira Yahyaoui, previously an influential activist in the Arab Spring in Tunisia, founded Mos to interrupt the cycle of skyrocketing student debt and unused government financial aid. Mos' platform checks over 30,000 eligibility criteria for students to access and aggregate all $135B in potential government aid into one single application.""Students shouldn't have to spend their weekends filling out forms to get grants and scholarships. It's incredibly stressful and all too easy to mess up,"" says Yahyaoui. ""Unfortunately, the easiest way to pay for college today is contracting a big private student loan that can alter the course of a student's life. I believe every student should get every dollar possible in free, no-strings-attached funding before they take on debt.""To help fund their efforts to make financial aid and resources more accessible for students, Mos has raised $13 million in Series A financing in a round led by Sequoia Capital with participation from Stephen Curry, Zoom founder Eric Yuan, Emerson Collective and Lux Capital, among others. Prior investor Uber co-founder Garrett Camp's startup studio Expa also participated in the round. ""Mos opens new doors to students who want to go to college without taking on huge amounts of debt,"" said Jess Lee, partner at Sequoia. ""As COVID-19 impacts the financial futures of American students, there has never been a greater need for them to be empowered and educated around their financial options. We are proud to be partnering with Amira and her team as they help students access financial aid."" Student Rights During COVID-19: The Ultimate GuideIn addition to providing a first-of-its kind application for students seeking financial aid, Mos is directly responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has upended the lives of 20 million college students and 3.7 million high school seniors in the US. The company is launching The Ultimate Guide to COVID-19 for students to address the dearth of easily accessible, consolidated information and resources for students in the time of COVID-19. The free guide provides instructions, templates, and more to help students who have been forced to put their futures on hold, are being charged tuition for no class, evicted from housing with no options, and told to wait indefinitely for admissions and financial aid decisions. Mos created the guide after hearing from students about the anxiety, hardship, and profound uncertainty the crisis has caused. The guide is updated daily, combines knowledge from experts across financial aid and education. Instead of simply providing advice like most articles, it offers a set of email and letter templates that students can use immediately to make effective housing petitions, information requests, payment deferments, and special circumstances appeals. ""The lack of information out there shouldn't cost young people their futures. It doesn't have to be this way,"" says Yahyaoui. ""Students have more rights than they know about to advocate for themselves, seek tuition reimbursements and loan forgiveness, oppose evictions, and get answers to their questions.""From the early days of the crisis, Stephen Curry played an impactful role in raising swift awareness and education around COVID-19. ""This guide is exactly what students need right now- clarity on the ways COVID-19 impacts their education, and what resources are available to them to help navigate the often complex process of financial aid,"" said the six-time NBA All-Star. Millions of students are already eligible for professional judgment appeals related to COVID-19. Mos started by offering the guide to its network of 200,000 students, but wanted to do more to empower the current and future college students of America, so the company is making the guide available to the public and any student, educator or parent looking for resources.

QSRs are now adapting technology to support growing volume on voice-based ordering channels such as drive-thru, phone and self-service kiosks to enable contactless ordering.ConverseNow's Voice AI platform has been helping QSRs by automating and personalizing the ordering process, driving efficiencies and reducing customer wait times.

Since launching in December 2019, Charityvest has facilitated giving to over 300 nonprofits and received nearly $2M in charitable contributions from donors.Charityvest uses donor-advised funds (DAFs), which have traditionally been marketed to wealthy donors.

It aims to foster habits of intentional giving among donors, which has been shown in numerous studies to increase positive psychological effects and decrease anxiety and depression.In addition to providing charitable giving funds to individuals or families, the company plans to grow by providing businesses the ability to sponsor tax-advantaged charitable giving funds for employees and provide churches with a free digital solution to collect donations from members.The venture was first envisioned by Stephen Kump at Yale University in 2016 where he was an MBA student at the time. ""My wife and I made a commitment to give a percentage of our income away and we wanted a donor-advised fund to manage it, but the fees and experience of traditional funds didn't make sense for us or our friends,"" said Kump, the venture's CEO.

Historically, the healthcare system has been organized around treating the sick and compensating providers on the volume of services ordered, an arrangement commonly known as fee-for-service. Value-based delivery rewards providers for the quality of care they give to their patients.

Span,"Span is advancing the future of distributed clean energy with a smart panel that delivers an intuitive interface to the home. The Span panel replaces the standard electrical panel, providing transformative transparency and control over energy use and enabling customers to easily adopt solar, storage, electric vehicles, and other clean energy technologies.",Series A,"$10,200,000",12 May 2020,Span Secures $10.2M Series A,https://vcnewsdaily.com/span/venture-capital-funding/ymgfxrttfw,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Span has secured a $10.2 million Series A financing.",San Francisco,CA,https://vcnewsdaily.com/Span/venture-funding.php,"Span, the rising smart panel company led by executives and lead engineers from Tesla, Amazon Echo, and Sunrun, has raised $10.2 million to transform the electrical panel into an intelligent gateway for every home and expand the adoption of solar, energy storage, and electric vehicles. Span's smart panel provides intuitive monitoring and controls for all circuits alongside unprecedented flexibility for battery backup during power outages. The Series A round was led by ArcTern Ventures and joined by Capricorn Investment Group, Incite Ventures, and existing investors.""Self-sufficiency and control within the home are top-of-mind for many homeowners with power outage concerns now compounded by coronavirus shelter-in-place orders,"" said Span founder and CEO Arch Rao, who formerly led the product team at Tesla Energy for the Powerwall. ""Last fall, power outages affected millions in California, and shutoffs are starting again as utilities perform precautionary maintenance in fire-risk areas. We developed the Span smart panel to give homeowners greater energy independence in the face of these growing challenges. With Span, they have greater control over their home energy, especially when they need it most.""Delivering much more than the passive current protection of the traditional electrical panels found in every home, the Span smart panel enables digital automation of home energy and more streamlined installations for clean energy upgrades. While the standard electrical panel has not seen major innovation for nearly a century, today's homes are in need of new functionality to better manage modern connected devices, appliances, electronics, and energy upgrades such as solar panels, batteries, and EV charging systems.Span's smart panel provides monitoring and control for 32 circuits, all managed through a smartphone interface. When the power goes out, Span automatically islands the house and allows homeowners to select what parts of their homes they want to power, going far beyond existing solutions that are limited to covering just a few critical loads.The Span panel is listed to UL standards that mirror this step-change in functionality: UL standard 67 for the regular electrical panel as well as UL 916 for energy management equipment and UL 869A for service equipment.For installers performing solar and storage installations, the panel reduces labor by streamlining the total number of components. Early estimates indicate the installation time to be 50 percent faster than current solutions, resulting in fewer components required and a smaller, more streamlined overall installation.Nest co-founder Matt Rogers joined the funding round through Incite Ventures.""We founded Nest to reinvent the largest energy user at home, the thermostat. We replaced an ugly household device with something that invited interaction and saved energy. Span has the potential to solve that for every load in the home. That's why I've come on board as an investor to Span and an advisor to Arch.""Span's new investors join a strong base of existing investors, including Wireframe Ventures, Congruent Ventures, Ulu Ventures, Energy Foundry, Hardware Club, 1/0 Capital, and Wells Fargo Strategic Capital. Since launching the product in late 2019, the company has seen significant demand in the residential market from solar plus storage installers, homebuilders, energy companies, and homeowners. Funding will be used to meet this demand and scale Span's panel to households across the U.S.Managing Partner at ArcTern Ventures Murray McCaig sees massive potential for Span's technology to scale and significantly improve how solar and storage can work for homes.""We see an incredible opportunity in the solar-plus-storage market, one that Span is extremely well-positioned to capitalize on. Span combines this opportunity with an exceptional team and a deep understanding of the market.""Dipender Saluja, Managing Director at Capricorn Investment Group's Technology Impact Fund and an early investor in Tesla, sees Span's combination of engineering innovation and consumer focus as a strong parallel.""We have seen the tremendous impact new hardware technologies can have in transforming incumbent industries. I am excited to partner with Arch to deliver a much needed revolution to electrical infrastructure and the distributed energy market.""Existing investors are aligned around a similar drive to help scale the growing solar and storage market. Paul Straub of Wireframe Ventures led Span's seed round investment and sees Span as a critical next step to advance distributed clean energy.""Span seamlessly integrates into the home and helps consumers get the most out of solar and storage,"" says Straub. ""It will play a central role as more homeowners seek clean energy, flexible backup power, greater resiliency, and easy control of their homes.""In addition to the new investment round, Mary Powell, former CEO of Vermont utility Green Mountain Power and a leader in transforming the energy system to be better distributed to homes, businesses, and communities, will join Span's board as an independent member.""Mary Powell is one of the most forward-thinking energy executives I've had the privilege of working with,"" says Span CEO Arch Rao. ""She set an example of what a customer-focused utility could look like, bringing the Tesla Powerwall to thousands of customers in the state of Vermont. I'm excited to work with her again as we bring our panel to market.""Span has established channel partnerships with solar and storage installers, as well as leading battery storage providers like LG Chem to commercialize the product. Span is focused initially on California and Hawaii as key markets, both states with high rates of solar and battery storage adoption, with plans to expand more broadly in the U.S. this year.Homeowners and installers who are interested in Span can visit www.span.io to learn more, including California homeowners who want to join Span's Early Access program.About Span.IO, Inc.Span is advancing the future of distributed clean energy with a smart panel that delivers an intuitive interface to the home.

This initiative is an integral part of the company's expansion into life sciences, which include efforts to develop a large-scale vaccine platform targeting seasonal and pandemic influenza, and rapid response to emerging viruses, such as the novel coronavirus.mRNA-based vaccines offer the potential to address pandemics because of shorter pre-clinical development times compared to traditional vaccines. This has allowed GreenLight to quickly prepare a set of COVID-19 vaccine candidates for laboratory and pre-clinical evaluation of their safety and efficacy.This round of funding is aimed at establishing a scaled process under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), capable of supporting clinical development and enabling the production of billions of doses of COVID-19 vaccine using GreenLight's proprietary bioprocessing technology.

The round was led by Energy Impact Partners, who were joined by Zetta Venture Partners, cybersecurity veteran Niloofar Howe, and other undisclosed investors. This round follows a $7M seed round led by Drive Capital, a Midwest based fund with $1.2B under management, bringing the total company funding to $19.5M.Based in Columbus and founded in 2017 by Matt Wyckhouse, founder and former CTO of Battelle's Cyber Business Unit, Finite State has remained largely in stealth mode as its team has worked diligently on building advanced technology that uncovers vulnerabilities and threats in the supply chain of IoT and connected devices. Despite keeping a low profile, the company widely showcased its unique capabilities in June of 2019 when its Huawei Supply Chain Assessment revealed numerous backdoors and major security vulnerabilities in the Chinese technology company's networking devices that could be used in 5G networks. The report has been cited by government officials, cybersecurity experts, and in news and media around the world. This round of funding will allow Finite State to scale its team of world-class engineers, whose mission is focused on advancing the company's cutting-edge technology that enables unprecedented visibility into device firmware. With its focus on users and manufacturers of connected devices in the energy, telecommunications, and national security sectors, an expanded team will give Finite State the bandwidth to secure some of the world's most critical infrastructure.""The exponential growth of connected devices powering our critical infrastructure is driving attackers to change their tactics and target these more vulnerable devices,"" said Matt Wyckhouse, Founder and CEO of Finite State. ""Finite State focuses on creating transparency within supply chains, so manufacturers and end users can work together to mitigate vulnerabilities before they are exploited.""""The proliferation of internet of things (IoT) devices has enabled a smarter and more resilient electric grid. As operators rapidly deploy IoT devices for critical industrial and business functions, the stakes have never been higher for security teams to keep up with the risks and vulnerabilities that exist within these devices,"" said Sameer Reddy, partner at EIP. ""We're excited to partner with Finite State as the company brings its platform to the energy sector to provide operators with exceptional, real-time intelligence of supply chain risk.""""Finite State takes a uniquely data-driven approach to discovering vulnerabilities in the IoT fabric that now powers every part of the economy from transportation to health care to fundamental infrastructure,"" said Jocelyn Goldfein of Zetta Venture Partners. Zetta was also among the company's initial investors. She goes on to say that ""IoT represents the new frontier of cyber attacks, and Finite State's unique threat intelligence is an invaluable assist for defenders."" PRIORITIZING SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITYThe complexity of supply chains for connected devices makes it extremely difficult to know whether or not a device is truly secure. Because device manufacturers source parts and software from many different vendors, it is challenging for them to understand and mitigate the risks their devices pose without extensive testing. Through firmware analysis on behalf of device manufacturers and their customers, Finite State's platform is able to automatically scan each device and provide an in-depth analysis into the device's firmware, including the presence of known vulnerabilities, potential backdoors, supply chain threats, and other crucial information that affects the overall risk of each device. This information is key to allowing end users to understand and mitigate the risk presented by each device, and it allows OEMs to address and resolve these issues and share the risk analysis with their customers. This transparency is the key to creating more secure supply chains and ensuring safer networks in all industries from utilities to manufacturing, healthcare to government systems.ABOUT FINITE STATEThe mission of Finite State is to protect the devices that power our modern lives by illuminating the vulnerabilities and threats within their complex software supply chains.

Enabling this through a single blood draw could improve patient access and adherence to cancer screening and address disparities in cancer care by improving access for rural, vulnerable, and under-served populations. We are delighted that such a high-quality group of investors share our vision and recognize the public health benefits of our technology.""The Series D funding adds to the company's balance sheet and will support continued development and commercialization of GRAIL's multi-cancer early detection blood test. Since early 2016, GRAIL has raised more than $1.9 billion in four rounds of equity financing to pursue reducing cancer mortality worldwide through multi-cancer early detection.About GRAIL's Multi-Cancer Early Detection TestGRAIL's multi-cancer early detection test is designed to detect cancers in early stages, when the chance of survival is higher than if cancer is detected after symptoms appear. Clinical data have shown the ability of this technology to detect more than 50 cancer types with a very low false positive rate of less than one percent. GRAIL's test was designed to minimize false positives in order to limit associated harms, including patient anxiety and unnecessary diagnostic workups. When a cancer signal is detected, the test has been able to identify where in the body the cancer is located with high accuracy, an important step to guiding diagnostic next steps and care.GRAIL's methylation-based technology preferentially targets the most informative regions of the genome and is designed to use its proprietary database and machine-learning algorithms to both detect the presence of cancer and identify the tumor's tissue of origin. GRAIL believes its sequencing database of cancer and non-cancer methylation signatures is the largest of its kind.About GRAILGRAIL is a healthcare company whose mission is to detect cancer early, when it can be cured. GRAIL is focused on alleviating the global burden of cancer by developing pioneering technology to detect and identify multiple deadly cancer types early. The company is using the power of next-generation sequencing, population-scale clinical studies, and state-of-the-art computer science and data science to enhance the scientific understanding of cancer biology, and to develop its multi-cancer early detection blood test. GRAIL is located in Menlo Park, California and Washington, D.C. It is supported by leading global investors and pharmaceutical, technology, and healthcare companies.

With this, Illumina's Nick Naclerio, founding partner, and HLM's Steven Tolle, partner, will be joining LetsGetChecked's board as members.WHAT IT DOESFounded in 2014, LetsGetChecked provides consumer customers with a range of at-home testing kits, such as ones for hormone levels, sexually transmitted infections, liver performance, nutrition and - specifically for frontline healthcare workers - COVID-19.Customers receive their kit in the mail, with which they collect and return a personal sample for testing. One of the startup's lab partners analyzes the sample and returns it to a LetsGetChecked physician, who reviews the results and counsels customers - over the phone, if necessary. For later reference, test results are saved in a LetsGetChecked patient app that interfaces with Apple Health, Fitbit, Garmin and other consumer-friendly health tools.As of March, the company has also been offering a COVID-19 ""twin-track"" antibody and PCR test exclusive to providers working at the point of care. However, the company said it hopes to release a direct-to-consumer version of the testing kit down the road.""The company's work has never been more important now that the world faces a global pandemic, forcing us all to re-evaluate how we obtain health and wellness services,"" Illumina's Naclerio said in a statement. ""LetsGetChecked is already having a profound impact on patient-led at-home healthcare, which is necessary now and will become increasingly common in the future.""WHAT IT'S FORThe company said these funds will help build up its manufacturing, supply and testing capacity for COVID-19. It will be increasing activity at its California laboratory while boosting operations and partnerships across the U.S. and Europe.""We have been developing our platform for more than five years and have helped hundreds of thousands of individuals by enabling access to high-quality testing and telehealth services in the home, across many health conditions,"" Peter Foley, CEO and founder of LetsGetChecked, said in a statement. ""With the onset of COVID-19, we realigned resources with a view to helping with this global pandemic and are currently delivering tens of thousands of tests per day to critical and frontline healthcare workers""MARKET SNAPSHOTConsumer-facing home testing startups were already picking up momentum around the time of LetsGetChecked's $30 million Series B, with competitors like EverlyWell, healthy.io and Scanwell Health all announcing new rounds or services over the course of the last year. However, COVID-19 has ramped up demand across the industry and led to some confusion with the FDA on more than one occasion. But the window for these companies to take their COVID-19 tests directly to consumers appears to be reopening: It was just a few weeks ago that LabCorp's COVID-19 RT-PCR test became the first permitted for at-home sample collection.ON THE RECORD""HLM invests in companies that inherently drive adoption due to the need they serve, and companies that leverage important market trends,"" Tolle said in a statement. ""In this case, LetsGetChecked is helping to improve consumer access to care, which is increasingly essential."""

Invisible AI offers the industry's first no-code, edge-based computer vision platform. Their first application tracks body movement to improve manual assembly processes in manufacturing facilities. Invisible AI's technology augments the workforce by giving operators real-time feedback to increase productivity, improve quality, and ensure safety.Earlier this year, Invisible AI was showcased by Toyota Motor North America as one of four technologies augmenting the workforce on the manufacturing floor of the world's largest automaker.""We are proud to be working closely with 8VC and other strategic partners to help us advance the product and meet demand,"" said Eric Danziger, CEO of Invisible AI. ""We are already working with some of the best names in manufacturing, but we believe every organization can benefit from our AI-enabled cameras. Our service helps to assure high quality, a safe workplace, and replicate best practices throughout manufacturing facilities.""Introducing Invisible AI's edge computer vision platformBusinesses are starting to rapidly install cameras to gain visibility but this simply increases the burden on employees to review the video to gain insights. Invisible AI instead uses computer vision to help businesses answer critical questions, consistently and inexpensively. Specifically, the inability for manufacturers to monitor assembly processes results in millions of dollars of waste, lost worker time and preventable human injury or error. With this first product, Invisible AI has seen strong demand within top-tier manufacturing companies and this round of funding will be used to rapidly grow the team and expand product capabilities.Invisible AI's low-bandwidth and low-cost cameras can be deployed at each workstation to enable full visibility into assembly processes. This computer vision technology operates entirely at the edge with deep learning models 100x smaller than the current state-of-the-art technology available today. The proprietary, custom solution can be deployed in hours, compared to their competition which typically has a lead time of 8 weeks. There is also built-in privacy, with no video data stored in the cloud and no facial data ever utilized.""8VC is excited to help Invisible AI expand its reach and grow its customer base,"" said Alex Moore, partner at 8VC.

As part of the deal, Lime will acquire Uber's Jump bike-sharing business operations and the two companies will expand the integration of their mobile apps.The investment round valued Lime at $400 million, a person familiar with the terms said, asking not to be identified because they're private. That's a massive drop from the $2.4 billion investors priced the company at in a funding round last year. Lime didn't comment on the valuation in the statement.Venture capitalists have invested more than $1 billion in the last few years in two startups renting electric scooters -- Lime and Bird -- but they began falling out of favor this year. First unprofitable business models fell out of fashion, and then the pandemic kept customers stuck at home. Both companies had to drastically reduce their fleets by mid-March.Lime said in January it was cutting 14% of staff, about 100 employees, and retreating from a dozen markets in a drive toward profitability. In March it said it was ""winding down or pausing"" service in all markets but South Korea. And in April, further job cuts were announced.Lime said its chief executive officer, Brad Bao, would be replaced by Wayne Ting, previously the company's head of operations. Bao will continue as board chairman.Global self-isolation measures and government bans on travel had decimated Lime's ability to generate revenue from the hundreds of thousands of scooters it has around the world. The company went from 147,000 scooter trips globally on March 14 to about 52,000 three days later as Europe went into lockdown.Scooter companies are also suffering from a sharp decline in transportation spending and a newfound aversion to the sharing economy. This combination of factors is also weighing heavily on Airbnb Inc., Getaround Inc., Lyft Inc. and Uber. Lyft said Wednesday that it's cutting 17% of its workforce."

Not only does Emtrain's solution meet increasing state and federal compliance training regulations, but it also diagnoses issues that are otherwise invisible to business leaders and benchmarks those issues against a global average so that internal stakeholders know where to focus their time and attention for maximum and measurable results. The diagnostic tool and data provide a win/win for employers and employees who both want to prevent these issues but lack the visibility, tools and organizational structure to do so effectively.Emtrain's recently launched Emtrain.ai solution has already collected over seven million employee sentiment responses about core culture indicators that exist in organizations such as power dynamics; in-group/out-group dynamics; unconscious biases and other indicators that correlate with a higher risk for bad culture outcomes. The company's initial report, Emtrain's 2020 Workplace Culture Report, published in March, shows that only 17% of employees will report sexual harassment to HR if they see or experience it.  Other data is consistent in that it shows employees don't typically report problems. The result is these problems remain invisible to HR and compliance leaders until there's an explosive incident that rocks the culture. ""Our changing demographics, social norms and current tough business climate require a better solution to educate employees of their rights and responsibilities and how to be a culture leader while informing employers where they need to focus their time and attention to support a healthy culture,"" said Janine Yancey, Founder and CEO of Emtrain.

Business leaders are increasingly demanding business value from these programs and a way to solve behavioral problems before they turn into bad outcomes. Emtrain uses data, analytics, and benchmarking to show companies where they are vulnerable and how to address their hotspots in a proactive way.""""Janine has a bold, unique vision on how to change the way organizations identify their risk and prevent complex culture issues from becoming damaging,"" said EGP Managing Partner Peter Campbell.

Covariant will use the funding to accelerate its partnerships, introduce AI Robotics to new industries, and grow its research, engineering and commercial teams.From food distribution to healthcare to e-commerce, the global supply chain is facing unprecedented pressure to deliver orders quickly, reliably and efficiently, while keeping workers safe. Automation is the key to meeting those challenges.While repetitive and predictable tasks like the movement of goods have successfully been automated, complex and unpredictable tasks that require hands, such as picking, placing and unloading, have not. Traditional automation can't handle the constant change and infinite variability of these tasks. Automating them requires advanced AI that can understand, learn and adapt.Founded in 2017, Covariant is building the Covariant Brain, universal AI that enables robots to see, reason and act autonomously in the real world. Covariant robots learn general abilities such as robust 3D perception, physical affordances of objects, few-shot learning and real-time motion planning which gives them the intelligence to learn how to manipulate new objects they've never seen before in environments where they've never operated.In January 2020, Covariant launched from stealth to reveal that it had reached a new AI milestone: its AI Robotics stations were running consistently at customer facilities in North America and Europe in the apparel, pharmaceutical and electronics industries, and had achieved autonomy in live production, with a mean unassisted operating time greater than one hour.""When we founded Covariant, our goal was to make AI Robotics work autonomously in the real world,"" said Pieter Abbeel, Covariant's President, Chief Scientist and co-founder. ""Having reached that milestone, we see a huge benefit in expanding our universal AI to new use cases, customer environments and industries.""The funding comes on the heels of significant momentum for the company. Soon after launching from stealth, Covariant invested in strategic partnerships to accelerate the deployment of robotic stations to customers. In February, Covariant announced a partnership with ABB, a leading industrial robotics supplier. In March, Covariant joined forces with Knapp, a leading supplier of intralogistics systems.""As the coronavirus crisis has exposed serious frailty in the global supply chain, we're seeing more demand than ever for our AI Robotics solutions,"" said Peter Chen, Covariant CEO and co-founder. ""Our customers are eager to invest in AI and scale it across their supply chains to meet growing demands and more stringent requirements. This latest funding round, along with our recent partnerships, will allow us to scale quickly across multiple industries.""As a part of the investment, Mike Volpi, partner at Index Ventures, will be joining Covariant's board.""We've been blown away by Covariant's team of world-class AI researchers and roboticists and the universal AI they've built,"" said Mike Volpi, partner at Index Ventures. ""Covariant's AI, powered by deep learning, will unlock the next wave of robots that learn.

Next Coast Ventures led the round with participation from Meridian Street Capital.Additional investors in the round include former athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush, Everlywell CEO Julia Cheek, Bright Health CTO Brian Gambs and Capital Factory. The funding will be used to recruit a top team of engineers and designers to scale the HSA offering and build new functionality for First Dollar's platform.Today, the nation's more than 26 million Health Savings Accounts control $61.7 billion in assets, but the healthcare industry is the primary beneficiary of that total. Most users allow their contributions to sit idle, turning a potential investment vehicle into an under-utilized bank account. Only 11% of participants maximize their contributions each year, and only 13% invest their HSA savings for growth. Even worse, many HSAs charge a monthly fee, so savings are slowly depleted by as much as $100 per year.Empowering Consumers with a Modern Health Care Savings Account PlatformTo solve these problems, First Dollar co-founders Jason Bornhorst and Colin Anawaty set about building an HSA people will actually use. There are no monthly fees, and there will be a heavy focus on easy-to-understand language, education on how to maximize savings and an offering of high-quality health care products at fair prices. No other company offers this complete ecosystem.""HSAs are the worst-marketed health care benefit in the United States,"" said Bornhorst, First Dollar CEO. ""Most of them are effectively little-used bank accounts. We're building a product that not only helps you maximize your savings but also offers great health care at a great price. We believe that for every $1 you put into your First Dollar HSA, you should get $2 in value back in savings and spending.""""I've been an HSA user for years, and it's an amazing tool if you know how to use it,"" said Anawaty, First Dollar's chief product officer. ""The products on the market, though, don't live up to the power of the HSA. I'm excited to build a product that people will love that makes their finances healthier and also helps them make more informed decisions about their long-term health.""First Dollar targets Millennials and Gen Z, a generally healthy population that typically spends too much per year for more coverage than they need. Only 1 in 5 people in those demographics reach their deductible amount each year. First Dollar believes they would be better served by putting the money they spend on premiums into a simple, informative, 100% fee-free HSA account.Investor Perspectives on First Dollar Seed Funding Round""Two of the biggest concerns on people's minds today are their money and their health,"" said Mike Smerklo, Next Coast Ventures co-founder and managing partner. ""In an ever-changing healthcare market, it pays to have leaders who know the space. As co-founders, Jason and Colin know this marketplace, having sold their previous company to athenahealth and then running athenahealth's Austin office. We're excited to partner with them as they redefine an old industry to help consumers get more for their money.""""Individuals and employees are increasingly taking responsibility back from the employer with regards to managing and spending their healthcare benefits,"" said Scott Law, general partner at Meridian Street Capital. ""After having worked closely with Jason and Colin from idea to company formation, I believe their unique blend of experiences in both consumer technology and health care will enable First Dollar to become the go-to resource for every American when it comes to healthcare benefits.""About First DollarFirst Dollar is revolutionizing how people think about and interact with healthcare.

Worldwide stay-at-home orders have dramatically increased demand for many businesses, putting increasing stress on the modern tech stack. Economic uncertainty is encouraging greater efficiency, setting the stage for further migration away from legacy, closed-source data platforms to modern, distributed, cloud-native tools. This round of funding will facilitate Cockroach Labs' growing investments in R&D to better support customers as they change to meet these new requirements. Enterprises in areas including communications, gaming and entertainment, e-commerce and financial services are scrambling to support increased consumer demand and remote workforces, and are finding that the resiliency and flexibility necessary to do so just isn't available without an elastically scalable, multi-cloud, modern data platform like CockroachDB.Since its inception in 2016, the CockroachDB next-generation SQL database has helped organizations move and manage critical transactional data in the cloud. The software has developed an ardent and loyal following among architects, developers, and academics by capitalizing on the failed cloud migration promises of legacy database players and the risks associated with ""lock-in"" from the large public cloud vendors. This has resulted in year-over-year commercial customer growth of 295 percent. And once these users found what they were looking for in CockroachDB, they have doubled-down-first-year customers have, on average, expanded their usage 2x, and have renewed at a rate of over 90 percent.Today, Fortune 500 CIOs are taking notice: while CockroachDB has only been available for two years, it is already in use at some of the world's largest enterprises across all industries, including Equifax, Bose and Comcast. More businesses are turning to CockroachDB to help in both expanding to meet new demand, reducing costs, and moving to the cloud. A recent survey of open roles, specifically for CockroachDB developers, on LinkedIn shows over 40 positions at 25 of the top enterprise companies across industries. Companies include Apple, Honey, Facebook, Tesla and Via.""The migration to a multi-cloud environment has long been underway at many, if not all, of the top global enterprises. What cannot be taken for granted in the rush to the cloud is resiliency and scalability, which is near impossible to do without a distributed database that is elastic and self-healing,"" said CEO and co-founder of Cockroach Labs, Spencer Kimball. ""It's a given that this is the way of the future. But as that future approaches faster than many expected it is putting immense pressure on the enterprise to make this leap now, as quickly and effortlessly as possible. CockroachDB was purpose-built for mission-critical, data-intensive, cloud-deployed applications, and as a result, we are seeing a tremendous increase in demand for our services from companies small and large looking for bulletproof resiliency, effortless scalability and an overall more cost-effective platform.""A Massive Market, Ripe for Disruption""The cloud has provided the opportunity to rethink all aspects of IT infrastructure and software,"" explained Tony Baer, principal at dbinsight. ""CockroachDB is a prime example of how the cloud is reinventing databases, removing traditional shackles to scale and volume that have constrained them, clearing the way for new forms of globally-distributed applications that weren't thinkable before.""The worldwide public cloud services market is forecasted to grow nearly 20 percent in 2020 to a total upwards of $260 billion, according to an analyst firm. It also expects that by 2022, 75 percent of all databases (which saw 18.4 percent of growth in revenue in 2018) will be deployed or migrated to a cloud platform. With double-digit growth in the database market, this represents a larger move away from legacy players like Oracle as companies look for more nimble cloud-native databases. Amidst such growth, the greatest innovation is coming from companies that arose out of the open-source software movement, many of which are poised to disrupt slower-moving players operating on either decades-old technology or on an assembly of services cobbled together via acquisition. As the world's first cloud-native, distributed SQL database, Cockroach Labs is the only player in the space built from the ground up with the needs of the global enterprise in mind.""Legacy players have long dominated the enterprise software market. With recent investments in companies like Confluent, Snowflake, and now Cockroach Labs, we're seeing huge market disruption as enterprises move to the cloud and build on a modern tech stack, replacing legacy companies, who are struggling to adapt,"" said Kevin Wang, partner at Altimeter Capital. ""Cockroach Labs is leading this next evolution with a world-class team, ambitious vision, and a transformative product.

The financing also attracted new investors Adage Capital Management, HealthQuest Capital, Partner Fund Management, and Rock Springs Capital, as well as existing investors. In addition, $17 million in growth capital was secured through CIBC Innovation Banking to refinance an existing debt facility.Proceeds from this financing will ensure that Pulmonx is well-capitalized to support the continued global commercial expansion of the Zephyr Valve System, the first FDA-approved minimally-invasive treatment option for severe emphysema, a form of COPD. The Zephyr Valve procedure, done through a simple bronchoscopy with no incision or tissue resection, is clinically proven to improve patients' breathing, exercise capacity, and quality of life, without the risks of major surgery.1""Ally Bridge is pleased to support Pulmonx in this oversubscribed financing,"" said Frank Yu, Founder, CEO and CIO of Ally Bridge Group. ""The combination of Pulmonx' Zephyr Valve System, patient assessment tools, established reimbursement programs, and global commercial footprint positions it as the world leader in interventional COPD procedures.""Emphysema is a progressive and life-threatening form of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and represents about 25% of all COPD patients. In the United States, COPD is the third leading cause of death and is expected to be associated with approximately $49 billion in direct medical costs in 2020. Emphysema is a debilitating and life-threatening disease that progressively destroys lung tissue, resulting in a diminishing ability to breathe and engage in the most basic daily activities, leading to further deconditioning and to a high mortality rate. It is estimated that more than 1.2M severe emphysema patients in the US, Europe and Japan are candidates for the Zephyr Valve treatment. Medical therapy delivers limited benefit in later stage patients, and because of the high risks and limited availability, surgical options are only available for a narrow patient population.""We are pleased to be able to accelerate our efforts to bring our landmark technology to severe emphysema patients who need it,"" said Glen French, CEO of Pulmonx. ""The recently secured financing will ensure we are able to continue to scale our commercialization efforts to meet the global demand for our Zephyr Valve System, as well as continue R&D efforts on new minimally-invasive pulmonary treatments.""About Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction with the Zephyr ValveBronchoscopic lung volume reduction with the Zephyr Valve is a one-time procedure performed through a bronchoscope, which requires no cutting or incisions. During the procedure, an average of four valves are placed in the airways to block off a diseased portion of the lung. The target area then reduces in size and allows adjacent healthier lung tissue to expand and function more efficiently. This results in patients being able to breathe more easily and experience less shortness of breath. Many patients treated with the Zephyr Valves have reported immediate relief and the ability to go back to doing everyday tasks with greater ease within weeks of treatment. Data from four published randomized controlled clinical studies have proven that the Zephyr Valve delivers significant and persistent improvement in pulmonary function, exercise capacity, breathlessness, and quality of life with less morbidity and mortality than surgical treatment options.2,3,4,5 These data have led to the inclusion of Zephyr Valves in several national and global treatment guidelines including the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellent (NICE) and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) which gives endobronchial valves a level 'A' evidence rating, the highest rating possible.About Pulmonx CorporationPulmonx is the global leader in interventional procedures for the treatment of COPD. It develops and markets non-surgical technologies for the assessment and treatment of patients with severe emphysema, a progressive and life-threatening form of COPD. The Pulmonx solution, which is comprised of the Zephyr Endobronchial Valve (Zephyr Valve), the Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System (Chartis System) and the StratX Lung Analysis Platform, is designed to treat severe emphysema patients who, despite medical management, are still profoundly symptomatic and either do not want or are ineligible for surgical approaches. The technology is supported by a compelling body of clinical evidence including over 100 published scientific articles regarding the clinical benefits of Zephyr Valves. FDA granted the Zephyr Valve a ""breakthrough device"" designation, and in June 2018 Pulmonx received FDA pre-market approval to commercialize our Zephyr Valve. The Zephyr Valve is now commercially available and physicians in more than 25 countries around the world routinely use the Zephyr Valves to improve the lives of patients with severe emphysema, with over 76,000 valves used to treat more than 19,000 patients worldwide to date.In addition to the Zephyr Valve System, the Company is planning further clinical trials of AeriSealÂ®, a foam-based lung sealant delivered through a bronchoscope to treat the subset of advanced emphysema that cannot be treated with the Zephyr valve.

In this way, ITI's vaccines (DNA or RNA) have the potential to utilize the body's natural biochemistry to develop a broad immune response including antibody production, cytokine release and critical immunological memory. This approach could put UNITE technology at the crossroads of immunotherapies in a number of illnesses, including cancer, allergy and infectious diseases. UNITE is currently being employed in Phase II clinical trials as a cancer immunotherapy. ITI is also collaborating with academic centers and biotechnology companies to study the use of UNITE in cancer types of high mortality, including cases where there are limited treatment options like glioblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia. ITI believes that these early clinical studies may provide a proof of concept for UNITE therapy in cancer, and if successful, set the stage for future studies, including combinations in these tumor types and others. Preclinical data is currently being developed to explore whether LAMP nucleic acid constructs may amplify and activate the immune response in highly immunogenic tumor types and be used to create immune responses to tumor types that otherwise do not provoke an immune response.About Immunomic Therapeutics, Inc.Immunomic Therapeutics, Inc. (ITI) is a privately-held, clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of vaccines through its proprietary technology platform, UNiversal Intracellular Targeted Expression (UNITE), which is designed to utilize the body's natural biochemistry to develop vaccines that generate broad immune responses. UNITE has a robust history of applications in various therapeutic areas, including infectious diseases, oncology, allergy and autoimmune diseases. ITI is primarily focused on applying the UNITE platform to oncology, where it could potentially have broad applications, including viral antigens, cancer antigens, neoantigens and antigen-derived antibodies as biologics. The Company has built a large pipeline from UNITE with six oncology programs and two allergy programs.

With this new funding, Pivot Bio will accelerate its plans to scale its first-to-market microbial nitrogen technology that increases crop yields and farmer revenue. The technology will also aid in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and global energy use related to the $65 billion global synthetic nitrogen fertilizer market. Pivot Bio PROVEN™, the company's inaugural product for corn, consistently delivers more nitrogen into the crop than synthetic nitrogen, translating to an average of 5.8 bushels per acre advantage when compared to fields using only synthetic nitrogen in 2019.By adopting Pivot Bio's cleaner nitrogen, agriculture will simultaneously achieve more consistent yields and eliminate one gigaton of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions (akin to removing 216 million cars off the road). Additionally, water-borne nitrates will be reduced, avoiding an estimated $4.1 billion in U.S. water purification costs and significantly reducing the dead zones in our oceans. These reductions are driven by Pivot Bio helping farmers shrink their use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer by at least 100 million metric tons over the coming decade.""Growers and our planet deserve a better fertilizer - one that balances on-farm economics with the farmer's commitment to leave the land better for the next generation, and Pivot Bio's technology helps them do just that,"" said Karsten Temme, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of Pivot Bio. ""The strong backing by our Series C investors enables Pivot Bio to redefine the future of fertilizer and provide the world's farmers with a new nitrogen source. Based on remarkable demand, we expect to ramp up from our large current footprint to millions of additional acres in the next growing season.""Pivot Bio PROVEN™ - in its second year of commercialization - has again sold out and is used on hundreds of thousands of acres of U.S. corn as farmers seek cleaner nitrogen technology that can increase their profitability. Pivot Bio will deploy Series C capital to rapidly expand internationally. Pivot Bio PROVEN™ will soon be available to Argentinian corn farmers, and through IN10T's FarmerTrials, Pivot Bio will launch Intent to Pivot on-farm corn trials for Canadian growers. Earlier this spring, the company launched its inaugural product for U.S. wheat crops, Pivot Bio RETURN™, through a limited, early-adopter program.""Pivot Bio's microbial nitrogen fertilizers are revolutionizing how farmers apply nitrogen to their crops, and we're excited to continue our investment to support this important mission,"" said Carmichael Roberts of Breakthrough Energy Ventures. ""The company is leading the charge on truly sustainable farming techniques, and we're confident that they'll continue to innovate their product offerings to solve this critical climate and societal challenge.""Manufactured, sold, and distributed to farmers in a radically different model from traditional synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, Pivot Bio's approach uses significantly less energy than the manufacturing of synthetic fertilizer, eliminates 99.5% of greenhouse gas emissions during its production, and is delivered through regular shipping carriers. This model eliminates the costly infrastructure of factories, pipelines, barges, and storage at brick-and-mortar retail locations. Instead, local trusted agronomic advisors can leverage a simplified mobile app to order and schedule on-demand delivery as they help farmers plan their nutrient management strategy.""Pivot Bio is addressing one of the most difficult challenges facing agriculture in the 21st century - reducing dependence on damaging synthetic fertilizer while increasing crop yields and creating better outcomes for farmers,"" said Matt Ocko, Managing Partner, DCVC. ""DCVC led Pivot Bio's early rounds and remains a major backer because we believe the company will truly transform global agricultural practices. We're pleased the company continues to bring its microbial nitrogen technology to new crops and new locations, across America and around the world.""""Farmer acceptance of our technology and support of our vision is far beyond our expectations,"" said Temme. ""They understand the economics and efficiencies our product offers - more consistent yields, 100 percent nitrogen efficiency with the crop, and a lighter environmental footprint. It's a triple bottom line for them and our planet.""Series C is co-led by return Series B investors Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Temasek and are joined by DCVC who led Pivot Bio's seed and Series A rounds; Prelude Ventures; Spruce Capital Partners; Codon Capital; Bunge Ventures; Continental Grain Company; Tekfen Ventures; Pavilion Capital; and individual investors Alan Cohen and Roger Underwood.
