# VC Funding Scrap and Store (In Progress)

## Project Goals
Analyzing data on new funding rounds and the funded companies, to help teams maximize the ROI of new/innovative markets by:
- Collecting data on venture captical funding rounds and the venture-funded companies.
- Cleaning/formatting the collected data and ordering it by funding date and time.
- Storing information into various forms of data such as excel, csv and SQL.

## Abstract
  Through data that is sourced from the VCNewsDaily website, this project collects information on new venture funding rounds, along with the associated details on the funding round and companies. To develop a clean list of leads [for education purposes] that can be used for various purposes such as: product development, market research and/or business development.

## Intro
  Venture capital as a funding type offers huge potential rewards, but with huge risks as well. In fact, it is well-known that most venture-funded startups never make it to the initial public offering (IPO) stage (althought this might not always end up being the most ideal end-goal (i.e., acquisition vs IPO)). But for those that do go through multiple venture funds and make it to the IPO, this type of funding has been responsible for most (if not all) of the newer tech giants that are now synonomous with Silicon Valley (i.e., Facebook, Google, Twitter, SalesForce, Uber, Doordash, Tesla). Given how venture capital works in stages, there is so much insight that venture funding reveals about developing trends in sales and/or technology.
  
  A team that does a great job of tracking venture capital activity is VCNewsDaily. Their website offers free venture capital details (funding round and company) on the 30 most recent fundings on their website at a time. They also have a search tool to search companies by the alphabet, along with a full catalog of venture capital details for all fundings over the recent years available for purchase. The goal of the study is to interpret the HTML data on the VCNewsDaily website into clean data that is stored into excel sheets and an SQL database. While no further analysis is done on the activity in venture capital market, this study provides the baseline tool for web scraping the data that will be needed for such an educational study on venture capital funding.
  
  Once collected and stored, this data can then be easily enriched and analyzed to help teams with market research, product development and/or business development. Market research from venture capital activity can be utilized by teams in the private equity and venture capital industries to help identify potential acquisitions / upcoming competitors. Product development teams in the various sciences industries (i.e., biotech, aerospace, electronics) can use VC activity to help identify upcoming technologies / methods that could offer parallel benefits to their own business. Business development teams can use VC activity to develop potential leads to go after (if good fit) or use it to systemically targets in their CRM based on funding activity (i.e., similar industry / region).
