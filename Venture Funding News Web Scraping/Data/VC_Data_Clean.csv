2020-09-11 00:00:00,Deel Collects $30M in Series B,https://vcnewsdaily.com/deel/venture-capital-funding/wvvrhqpvtz,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Deel has raised $30 million in Series B funding, led by Spark Capital.",San Francisco,CA,https://vcnewsdaily.com/Deel/venture-funding.php,"Deel, a payroll and compliance platform for international teams, today announced it has raised $30 million in Series B funding, led by Spark Capital. The investment closely follows a $14M Series A round, closed in May, led by Andreessen Horowitz. Deel's total funding now exceeds $48 million, including seed investment and participation from YC Growth Fund and notable angel investors including Nat Friedman, Ryan Petersen, John Zimmer, William Hockey and Alexis Ohanian.The global pandemic has accelerated the shift to remote work as many U.S. businesses give teams the freedom and space to choose where they work from, ensuring safety while also improving quality of life and operational costs. Without the need for employees to have a physical office presence, it has opened up the opportunity to recruit and hire talent from anywhere in the world.Deel's platform solves the largest logistical challenges that come with moving to a distributed, global workforce: payroll and compliance. Onboarding and paying workers across borders is complex, with specific currency and labor law requirements that vary by country. It can be both costly and time consuming.""We've squashed the conventional notion that there's a particular radius in which you can attract talent,"" said Deel co-founder and CEO, Alex Bouaziz. ""By bridging localized compliance and payments and then automating it, we are making a complex and manual process seamless and redefining U.S. companies' hiring pool to literally include qualified candidates from anywhere.""Deel supports over 500 companies and thousands of employees on their teams in more than 140 countries. The platform provides contracts and templates - legally vetted and compliant - to be used for tax forms and localized contracts, automated payment, invoicing and receipts and customer support. Both independent contractors and full-time employees are supported by Deel's technology.During the pandemic, Deel has experienced rapid growth. Deel's customer base has doubled and there are now 14x as many individual full-time employees and independent contractors on the platform since May.""We have filled 15 marketing and engineering roles with employees in 7 countries, using Deel's platform,"" said Julie Bissinger, Head of Operations for Near, Inc. ""Deel saves us hours of time every month and ensures we're compliant in our team members' local regions.""""Technology will be the great enabler in achieving workforce equality,"" said Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit and early-stage investor. ""Deel's platform makes more diverse hiring choices possible. Unbound by geography, businesses can hire the best person for the role, wherever and whoever they may be.""Fully-Remote FundingWhile the venture industry typically depends on in-person meetings to meet and evaluate investment opportunities, the investment landscape amidst COVID-19 has seen more firms forgo the handshake and opt for videoconferencing and other tools. Deel pitched and completed both its Series A and B funding entirely online with the help of remote collaboration and social and video platforms. Deel not only supports its customers' remote business operations, it benefits from its own product as well, employing a remote workforce spanning 15 countries.Spark Capital's General Partner, Yasmin Razavi reached out to Bouaziz over Twitter DM. This kicked off an 6-week back-and-forth series of Zoom meetings and calls in which the investment was made.""I was interested in Deel from the get-go as the best suited to be the winner in a category on the cusp of huge growth,"" said Razavi, General Partner at Spark Capital. ""The hurdles employers face when hiring employees in other global regions can be so Herculean, they ultimately give up on hiring their ideal candidate and settling for the most hirable. Deel eliminates those hurdles and enables employers to hire and onboard efficiently, allowing them to get to work faster.""Deel was co-founded in 2018 by MIT alumni Alex Bouaziz and Shuo Wang. The leadership team combines deep technical expertise with a strong partner network for regulatory and compliance, which includes more than 150 international labor law and accounting experts.ABOUT DEELDeel is the first payroll platform for remote teams that connects localized compliance and payments in one system of record.

The financing was led by Leaps by Bayer, the impact investment arm of Bayer AG. The syndicate also included new investors (Casdin Capital, Catalio Capital Management, LP, Laurion Capital Management, Samsara BioCapital and others) and all of Recursion's existing major institutional investors (Baillie Gifford, Mubadala, DCVC, Lux Capital, Obvious Ventures, Felicis Ventures, EPIC Ventures, Two Sigma Ventures, Advantage Capital, Intermountain Ventures and others).""We are ecstatic to have the opportunity to apply our ever-growing integrated discovery and development technologies to the hardest problems in biology, and this fundraising round provides us with additional resources we need to continue to advance on our mission to decode biology to radically improve lives,"" said Chris Gibson, PhD, co-founder and CEO of Recursion. ""We have made significant progress since our last financing a year ago - doubling the number of clinical and preclinical programs in our pipeline, doubling the size of our proprietary database of cellular images, and significantly expanding the capabilities of our deep-learning algorithms, as well as continuing to integrate new technologies at every step of the discovery process to create the first truly digitally-powered biotechnology company.""Proceeds from the financing will support the clinical development of Recursion's therapeutic pipeline which is the broadest and deepest pipeline to date of any company operating within the space of digitally-powered drug discovery. Additionally, Recursion will continue to invest in the development of its proprietary technology to enable improvements in many steps of the drug discovery process including the generation of massive relatable datasets sufficient for creating broad maps of human biology enabling target discovery, digital chemistry, predictive ADME/T and the digitization of in vivo studies. Through a focus on data relatability and machine learning approaches to analyze the petabytes of proprietary experimental data from Recursion's platform, Recursion believes that it can double the number of clinical and preclinical programs in its pipeline each year and accelerate therapeutic discovery and development. ""Leaps by Bayer is investing in transformative technologies with the ability to move the paradigm from treatment to cure,"" said Juergen Eckhardt, MD, Head of Leaps by Bayer. ""With a pipeline of over 30 programs ranging from early discovery to clinical stage, including four clinical stage assets, Recursion is defining and leading technology-enabled drug discovery and has the potential to help enable new curative treatments in a large spectrum of disease areas and discover therapeutic candidates for intractable diseases. We are honored to be joined in this financing by other healthcare and technology experts who share our belief that Recursion's approach to technology-enabled drug discovery will bring life-changing medicines to patients quickly and in a cost effective manner.""Alongside the Leaps by Bayer investment in the Series D financing, Recursion also announced a strategic collaboration agreement with Bayer to identify and develop novel treatments for fibrotic diseases of the lung, kidney, heart and more. In this partnership, Recursion and Bayer may initiate more than ten fibrosis programs with possible development and commercial milestone payments of more than $100 million per program plus royalties on future sales. Recursion will receive an upfront payment of $30 million in addition to the $50 million lead equity investment. The size and scope of this partnership represents the largest announced partnership within the space of technology-enabled drug discovery to date and is a model for how Recursion plans to form strategic partnerships in other therapeutic areas with complex biology including oncology, immuno-oncology, inflammation, neuroinflammation, aging and infectious disease while advancing its internal programs focused primarily on genetic diseases.About RecursionRecursion's mission is to decode biology to radically improve lives. Unraveling the exceptional complexity of biological systems and delivering the next generation of biotherapeutics at unprecedented speed and scale can only be achieved by bridging life science and technology. Recursion is the leader in digital biology, and has built the world's most advanced ultra-high throughput wet-lab and machine learning platform. Recursion's ability to generate proprietary, high-dimensional, multi-modal and relatable datasets of human cellular biology at massive scale, and apply advanced machine learning approaches to reveal novel biological relationships, has resulted in a proven, target-agnostic drug-discovery engine.Recursion has demonstrated the power of its platform to industrialize drug discovery by delivering a broad, clinical and preclinical pipeline spanning diverse therapeutic areas, positioning Recursion as the partner of choice in digitally-powered drug discovery. Recursion's ground breaking technology, inclusive culture and multidisciplinary team make it a destination for engineers and scientists who are passionate about trailblazing the frontier of digital biology.

Recursion uses a novel drug screening platform to efficiently reposition known drugs and shelved pharmaceutical assets to treat rare genetic diseases and other conditions. The company's original focus on rare genetic diseases is much needed, as there are more than 5,000 such conditions that together affect millions of Americans, and more than 95 percent of these diseases have no approved therapy. Recursion's novel drug screening platform combines experimental biology and bioinformatics in a massively parallel system to quickly and efficiently identify treatments for multiple rare genetic diseases, or any disease that can be modeled at the cellular level. The core of the approach revolves around high-throughput automated screening using high-content assays in human cells, which allows the near simultaneous modeling of hundreds of genetic and other diseases. Rich data from these assays is probed using advanced statistical and machine learning approaches, and the effects of thousands of known drugs, shelved drug candidates, and novel chemical matter can be investigated efficiently to identify those holding the most promise for the treatment of disease.",Series D,239000000.0

Co-investors in the round include venture firms OneWay and SmartGate, Andrew Peterson, CEO of Signal Sciences and Dave Cole, CEO of Open Raven.Seasoned security entrepreneurs each with 20+ years of industry experience, CEO Artyom Poghosyan and CTO Alex Gudanis founded Britive in 2018 to challenge inertia within the security solutions industry, which was slow to react to the new multi-cloud environments of modern enterprises. Existing solutions for protecting enterprise data struggle to meet the pace and complexity challenges of today's multi-cloud environments. Managing privileged access in cloud infrastructures using traditional tools is mostly manual, carrying a high operational overhead. Users tend to accumulate standing permissions as a result, which increases security risk. Additionally, privileges are often granted in perpetuity without ever being audited, making them preferred targets for attack.Britive's patent-pending technology delivers infinitely greater control over access privileges, allowing users to dynamically elevate their own privilege levels (on a pre-authorization basis) to perform key administrative tasks for the minimum time requirement. Britive's intelligent engine learns user behavior and recommends privilege right-sizing for users and machine IDs, while constantly monitoring for anomalies that indicate privilege misuse. Unlike the traditional ""always on"" permissions, Britive's dynamic permissioning is designed to minimize the available attack surface.""After 20 years in the industry, I can say that legacy security solutions are simply not agile or scalable enough for today's multi-cloud environments. It's not about improving what exists, it's about creating an entirely new platform of operations that's cloud-first."" says Poghosyan. ""Today's businesses need to operate at digital speed to stay competitive and to achieve that they need their security solutions to be as agile as cloud, with a single view and set of controls across various cloud systems and apps.""Funding comes on the heels of a number of strategic customer wins in North America, including a global automaker, Fortune 500 retail brand, national healthcare provider, and multinational communications company. Britive plans to apply the funds to further development of its platform technology for monitoring, analyzing, and dynamic orchestration of access privileges across cloud applications and infrastructure, as well as to rev up its go-to-market capability.""As crazy as it sounds, cloud security, and access management specifically, is among the most valuable and most exciting wedges into a sector I've seen in my career as a VC,"" said Kara Nortman, Partner at Upfront Ventures. ""Art and his team have incredible early traction with deep relationships in the space, and I'm confident in their ability to build a generationally transforming business. We couldn't be more thrilled to work with them on this journey.""    ""Multi-cloud deployments are quickly becoming an accepted reality in today's organizations. As organizations scale, privileged access management can quickly become a challenge. To effectively protect against insider and outsider threats, a major shift in our approach is needed,"" said Yassir Abouesselham, Chief Information Security Officer of Splunk and member of the Britive advisory board. ""Britive's cloud-native platform significantly reduces the attack surface, by enabling cloud application and infrastructure users to access the resources they need, when they need them and only for the duration of the transaction.

Kural and Sietstra spun the platform out of leading biomedical data company Seven Bridges, which they also co-founded together. Their mission is to leverage their deep bioinformatics expertise to translate insights on natural immune responses and cancer heterogeneity into meaningful patient outcomes.The Totient platform leverages tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) to identify novel tissue-specific antigens and develop matching high-affinity antibody therapeutics. Totient reconstructs antibodies from tissues affected by autoimmunity, infections, and cancer, collected from patients experiencing exceptional immune responses. Beginning with a population of over 50,000 samples, they have reconstructed antibodies against both known and novel extracellular oncology targets: GAGE1, GAGE2A, ANXA1, C4BPB, IL14A, BIRC7, HCLS1, GPR83, and others undisclosed. Totient's human-derived antibodies are high affinity and highly specific to tissue-specific antigens, and are well suited for cell therapies, ADCs, and bispecifics.""TLSs are a largely untapped source of naturally evolved, fully-human antibodies. Totient's technology enables successful assembly of antibodies from TLSs across thousands of samples,"" said Daniele Biasci, Totient VP of Immunology, on whose hypothesis the program was built.Now, as the broader scientific community mobilizes to address the coronavirus pandemic, Totient has adapted its platform and approach to aid in the effort to discover COVID-19 antibodies, which could be used to prevent and treat the virus. They recently announced a collaboration with Ginkgo Bioworks to reconstruct anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples. Existing efforts focus on blood-derived antibodies, so focusing on BALF samples will enable Totient and Ginkgo to mine a previously unexplored source of therapeutic candidates.Totient has attracted a diverse syndicate of investors, including Mission BioCapital, Sands Capital, Viva Biotech, Kaitai Capital, Tau Ventures, Jonathan Milner, and more.""Totient is addressing an important challenge of novel tissue-specific target discovery,"" said Steve Tregay, Managing Partner of Mission BioCapital. ""They are doing so by combining the natural learning and evolution happening in the TLSs in the human body with machine learning techniques. One can imagine many applications for their validated technology beyond oncology and COVID-19.""According to Jonathan Milner, co-founder and Deputy Chairman of Abcam, ""Totient has demonstrated an ability to correctly assemble antibodies from bulk patient RNA sequencing data, without the need for specialized single-cell or antibody sequencing. The approach enables Totient to express and screen antibodies from large and noisy archival datasets, without prior target knowledge.""Totient intends to advance a subset of their proprietary antibodies into the clinic while pursuing a broad and flexible partnering strategy for other candidates in parallel.About TotientTotient is an AI-driven biotechnology company that leverages tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) to identify novel tissue-specific antigens and develop matching high-affinity antibody therapeutics.

The medical malpractice system exists to ease the lives of those afflicted and provide actionable feedback to doctors and hospitals-but this industry has one of the highest levels of dissatisfaction and distrust due to the perceived randomness of lawsuit payouts. Justpoint is redesigning the medical malpractice litigation process from both sides: by allowing plaintiffs that have legitimate claims to identify and retain the best attorney for their case, even if their claim would have been previously dismissed by attorneys who considered its value too low, and by quickly identifying claims that don't have legal merits to decrease frivolous lawsuits against healthcare providers and insurers.Justpoint's artificial intelligence platform offers consumers a faster and better understanding of the legal merits of their claim as well as an instant understanding of its likely settlement amount. With this technology, plaintiffs will be able to understand how each law firm performs for their specific type of claim. Additionally, Justpoint connects the two parties-helping plaintiffs find the best lawyer for their case, and helping law firms quickly find cases with merit. The investment will be used for scaling the company, including the hiring of more engineers and designers, as well as expanding customer acquisition channels, customer support, and developing partnerships with medical malpractice insurance companies and self-insured hospitals.""Justpoint has identified a big inefficient market in medical claims and malpractice that is ripe for disruption. Leveraging their deep experience in healthcare and technology, they have put together a brilliant team of engineers and scientists to turn their vision into reality. Their ability to leverage technologies such as AI, machine learning, and predictive analytics will add tremendous efficiencies and cut wasteful processes across the value chain, improving payouts and transparency for consumers and reducing search times and costs for law firms,"" said Harry Langenberg of Optima Tax Relief.To build these machine learning models, the company created a database of over 300,000 historic and active claims to quickly decipher the medical merits of a claim and improve the efficiency and transparency of the system. By introducing technology to this typically manual process, Justpoint is, for the first time, analyzing over 900 plaintiff law firms' performance in a scalable manner and increasing attorney's efficiencies by helping them focus on cases with merit. Ultimately, this platform's goal is to fulfill the medical malpractice system's intended goal of incentivizing the whole healthcare industry to strive for higher quality - providing a positive incentive for high-quality providers and negative incentives to providers who disproportionately harm patients.""Our goal is to ensure that the medical malpractice system fulfills its promise with the help of artificial intelligence,"" said Victor Bornstein, CEO & Co-founder at Justpoint. ""We believe that better distinguishing lawsuits with merits and those without, as well as the future application of our technology in the clinical setting, will contribute to an improvement of health care provided to patients while providing a safety net for families that have suffered the consequences of medical mistakes. This additional capital will allow us to further impact the world of medical malpractice and meet the needs of our customers.""About JustpointJustpoint is an AI-first company redesigning the medical malpractice industry, offering consumers and law firms a faster and better way of understanding the legal merits of a claim as well as an instant prediction of the likely settlement amount.

The company also announced that it has received a $2.1 million Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The competitive NIH SBIR program funds early-stage small businesses seeking to commercialize innovative biomedical technologies.In January, PhotoniCare announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had granted clearance for its TOMi™ Scope for non-invasive imaging of the middle ear. The only technology capable of visualizing through the eardrum to assess middle ear fluid directly, the simple-to-use TOMi Scope helps to determine the presence or absence of fluid in the middle ear and to characterize the type of fluid.The presence of fluid in the middle ear is a primary indicator for determining ear infection, which is the leading cause of hearing loss, surgery and antibiotic use, especially in children. More than ten million children per year experience ear infections in the U.S. alone; however, the current gold standard of otoscopy is a rudimentary tool that looks only at the surface of the eardrum, leading to misdiagnosis rates as high as 50%.Designed to eliminate subjectivity and speculation, the TOMi Scope allows physicians, for the first time, to directly visualize fluid in the middle ear where ear infections reside, and to measure the fluid's density even in the presence of wax - providing objective data upon which to base their decisions. A recent 70-patient study with Children's National Health System in Washington, D.C., demonstrated 91% sensitivity and 90% specificity for TOMi Scope's technology for detecting fluid through the intact eardrum.The funds will be used to expand PhotoniCare's executive team, ramp up manufacturing, execute on the company's sales and marketing plan, fuel artificial intelligence development to enable real-time decision support for the TOMi Scope, and expand reimbursement activities and customer support.Company Appoints Jeff Hydar as Chief Commercial OfficerPhotoniCare also announced it has appointed Jeff Hydar, an award-winning strategic sales executive with over 20 years of pharmaceutical and medical device sales and leadership experience, as its new Chief Commercial Officer.

Other participating investors in this round include Amazon's Alexa Fund, Birchmere Ventures, Mountain State Capital and Riverfront Ventures.Founded in 2015, Aspinity leverages a unique class of machine learning enabled by proprietary analog circuit technologies, to dramatically improve battery life in smart electronic devices that are always on and always sensing the environment for acoustic, vibrational, or other ambient triggers. These devices are continuously consuming power while waiting for triggers such as voice to wake-up a voice-controlled TV remote or wireless earbuds, the sound of glass breaking to activate a smart home security system, or a change in vibrational frequency to provide early warning of equipment malfunction on the factory floor. While such smart devices are growing in popularity, e.g., SAR Insight & Consulting forecasts an installed base of 1 billion voice assistant devices in use by 2023, they are prone to short battery life because of the power required to continuously digitize and process all incoming sensor data, relevant or not.""Aspinity's mission is to help system designers solve a major pain point that users face on a daily basis - the necessity of recharging or replacing batteries way too frequently in their always-listening devices,"" said Tom Doyle, founder and CEO, Aspinity. ""Our new investment will allow us to speed deployment of our first neuromorphic analog-processing chip, which completely changes the way that incoming sensor data are handled. Instead of a system that immediately digitizes all data for further analysis, our chip uses near-zero power to analyze the sensor data while it is still in its native analog format, only waking the digital system when important data are detected. This makes our architecture a game-changer for manufacturers who want to make smart always-on devices with batteries that last up to 10 times longer. Just imagine wireless earbuds that last for months instead of a day on a single charge or a voice-activated TV remote that runs for years without battery replacement.""In related news, Aspinity announced the expansion of its board of directors with the appointment of Dr. Jimmy Kan, principal at Anzu Partners.""Until very recently, always-on sensing devices were generally too power-hungry, too data-intensive, and too costly to run on battery,"" said Kan. ""Aspinity is changing that paradigm with the first commercially available reconfigurable analog machine learning processors that intelligently focus the power resources of compact and connected always-on devices on data that really matter. We are excited to support them in transforming the next generation of smart IoT devices.""""In 2017, we welcomed Aspinity to the inaugural Alexa Accelerator program, powered by Techstars, which was created to advance Alexa in voice-enabled devices,"" said Paul Bernard, director, Amazon Alexa Fund. ""We joined their 2018 seed round and are investing again today to help Aspinity advance its distinctive method for improving the battery life in portable Alexa devices.""The new funding is intended to accelerate Aspinity's product roadmap, enhance the technical and partner support teams, and scale volume production to meet customer demand.",Aspinity,"Founded in 2015, Aspinity is transforming the design of always-on sensing devices that run on battery through the world's first ultra-low power, analog machine learning RAMP chip.

Fidelity Management and Research Company LLC was the largest investor in the round, which also included participation from other new investors and the company's current investors.""SHINE is grateful to Fidelity and all of our investors for providing us the capital to move our product commercialization efforts forward,"" said Todd Asmuth, president and chief financial officer of SHINE. ""SHINE continues to make strong progress in our work to commercialize molybdenum-99, an essential diagnostic isotope, and lutetium-177, a therapeutic isotope that is showing great promise for the treatment of cancer.""SHINE is building a first-of-a-kind medical isotope production facility in Janesville, Wis. The facility will initially produce molybdenum-99, or Mo-99, which is used in more than 40 million patient procedures annually. There has been little or no domestic production of the isotope for decades, causing chronic shortages of Mo-99. These shortages routinely and significantly affect the diagnosis and treatment of patients around the world.SHINE has off-take agreements with three of the world's largest Mo-99 distributors for the future supply of Mo-99. The company's production facility will be capable of supplying more than one-third of the global demand for Mo-99.Last October, the company created SHINE Therapeutics to focus on critical customer needs in the rapidly growing therapeutic isotope market. The division is working to commercialize lutetium-177, or Lu-177, a therapeutic isotope used to treat prostate, neuroendocrine and other cancers. SHINE's unique technology enables it to produce non-carrier-added, high specific-activity Lu-177, the form of the isotope most in demand by today's clinical trial sponsors.""This funding round will help SHINE's continuing efforts to commercialize vital diagnostic and therapeutic isotopes that will be created by our revolutionary, responsible production technologies,"" said Greg Piefer, founder and CEO of SHINE. ""The opportunity for SHINE to fill an urgent market need by creating a more robust supply of these isotopes was evident once again as patient supplies were being disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This equity round is an affirmation by high-quality investors of our long-term business strategy and the ongoing success of our efforts to build a U.S. production platform that will produce a reliable isotope supply, fill an urgent market need and meet the needs of tens of millions of patients each year.""About SHINE Medical Technologies LLCFounded in 2010, SHINE is a nuclear technology company working to become the world's leading provider of radioisotopes for nuclear medicine. The SHINE system uses a patented, proprietary manufacturing process that offers major advantages over existing and proposed production technologies. It does not require a nuclear reactor, is better for the environment, generates less waste and is compatible with the nation's existing supply chain for Mo-99. In 2014, SHINE announced the execution of Mo-99 supply agreements with GE Healthcare and Lantheus Medical Imaging. In 2015, with the help of Argonne National Laboratory, GE Healthcare demonstrated that SHINE Mo-99 can act as a drop-in replacement for reactor-based Mo-99. In 2016, SHINE received regulatory approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to construct its production facility. The company began construction of the facility in the spring of 2019 and strong progress on it continues. SHINE created SHINE Therapeutics in 2019 to enhance the company's ability to fill critical needs in the rapidly growing therapeutic isotope market.

Trade is on a mission to inspire better brewing by connecting coffee drinkers to the best craft coffee roasters. Through Trade, customers are able to discover new coffee and support local at a national level while small, independent businesses are gaining access to new consumers nationwide. Since its launch in 2018, the coffee subscription brand has built a base of loyal subscribers with 90% retention after the first order and has seen explosive growth in recent months more than tripling subscribers. With the new funding, Trade will further articulate its brand story to reach a wider audience, develop roaster support tools, and deliver great coffee experiences, enabling the service to attract new customers and in turn continue to help roasters thrive.""People are brewing at home more now than at any point in this century, yet the buying experience hasn't changed in decades. Our customers are passionate about good coffee, but struggle to find different brands and specialty coffees that meet their expectations for taste, quality and sourcing. Our brand and platform that connects coffee drinkers to roasters solves that problem. Through our curated selection, personalization technology and modern supply chain, Trade is opening specialty to a broader audience and will propel the category to capture a larger share of the $55B US coffee market,"" commented Mike Lackman, CEO of Trade. ""Madrona's marketplace and e-commerce expertise make them the perfect partner as we continue toward this vision.""""The specialty coffee market is highly fragmented, with amazing independent roasters all over the country serving local customers,"" said Scott Jacobson, Managing Director at Madrona Venture Group. ""While they roast great coffee, they have a hard time building their brand and scaling their business to reach a national audience. Trade helps them do just that, connecting roasters to customers across the U.S. who discover and delight in their product. We love marketplace businesses with strong value propositions to customers and suppliers, and are excited to partner with Trade to scale its marketplace for specialty coffee."" Trade is at the intersection of two large and accelerating shifts in the American coffee market: the shift toward specialty coffee, and the shift to in-home consumption via brewing. In just two years, Trade has shipped more than one million bags of coffee; and the company expects to ship another million in the next six months. The additional order volume from Trade served as a lifeline to roasters when their retail operations and wholesale orders halted earlier this year and has now enabled many to resume growth. Will Shurtz, co-founder of Methodical Coffee of Greenville, SC says, ""COVID has not just impacted, but completely changed our business. Before COVID, 90% of our roasting business was bulk orders for cafes and restaurants. Since joining the platform in March, Trade has grown to about 30% of our roasted coffee business.""Trade's 55+ roaster partners, spread across 38 states in the U.S., cite many other benefits to partnering with Trade, including operational efficiencies, a robust feedback loop to test and scale new coffees, and exposure to a broader audience. ""Top line numbers aside, being able to support the producers we work with, the importers, keeping our staff employed, keeping the roasters busy, buying from our non-coffee suppliers too; that's what's meant the most to us,"" says Trey Cobb, co-founder of Greater Goods Coffee Co. in Austin, TX. Aaron MacDougall of Broadsheet Coffee from Cambridge, MA echoes this sentiment: ""There are other, more substantial benefits to the relationship.

By examining at the molecular level what makes animal products craveable, the company will answer how plants can be optimally used to replace unsustainable diets currently centered around animals.Like the automotive transition from combustion to electric engines that are simpler and more efficient, Climax Foods aims to make products that are smarter and safer for consumers than their animal-based predecessors. To unlock the full potential of plants, an infinite number of ways to combine the hundreds of thousands of plant sources would need to be investigated. To simplify this immense task, Climax Foods has created sophisticated machine learning frameworks to unlock all that plants naturally have to offer. The substantial seed round will provide capital to fuel deep research in taste, flavor, texture, and nutrition of the most desired animal-based food categories, starting with cheese.Oliver Zahn, the company's CEO, started Climax Foods to solve humanity's greatest problems through food solutions. Zahn says, ""We are at a pivotal time where industrialization enabled explosive population growth and consumption of animal products. Today, more than 90% of all mammalian animals and more than 70% of all birds on the planet exist for the sole purpose of metabolizing plants and being turned into food. This industry is complex and wasteful, creating as much climate change as all modes of transportation combined, and using more than a third of the earth's water and usable land. By speeding up food science innovation, Climax Foods is able to convert plants into equally craveable foods without the environmental impact.""Investors include At One Ventures, founded by visionary GoogleX co-founder Tom Chi, as well as Manta Ray Ventures, S2G Ventures, Valor Siren Ventures, Prelude Ventures, ARTIS Ventures, Index Ventures, Luminous Ventures, Canaccord Genuity Group, Carrot Capital and Global Founders Capital. The oversubscribed seed round also includes several mission-aligned angel investors.Tom Chi of At One Ventures says, ""Climax Foods is unlocking a frontier of how expressive we can be with plant-based foods. They are laying the foundation for a future where healthy, affordable, plant-based foods rival or even surpass the flavor of the animal-based foods they are replacing. Beyond being delicious, the work is crucial for the transition away from unsustainable animal agriculture which drives massive habitat destruction and generates more than 25% of total greenhouse gas emissions.""Sanjeev Krishnan, one of the largest investors in the plant protein space and Chief Investment Officer of S2G Ventures, who invested in Beyond Meat, one of the most successful IPOs of 2019 says, ""Climax Foods is tackling the same opportunity to change the market and the food system, but they are doing it with an entirely novel technological approach. They are using data science to produce a new category of foods that will not merely compete with, but has the potential to out-compete, traditional proteins in terms of taste, nutritional density, and price. The machine intelligence approach Climax Foods is pioneering is critical for harnessing the vast number of ways raw ingredients and natural processes can be used to create the ultimate digital recipes.""Leah Volger from Manta Ray Ventures says, ""Aged cheese has been a challenging category but the data-driven approach of Climax Foods has created prototypes like nothing I've ever tasted on or off the market.""The new company brings together heavy talent from across the food and technology industries. CEO Zahn, PhD, studied astrophysics at Harvard, and together with two Nobel laureates directed the Center for Cosmological Physics at UC Berkeley.

She is also an associate producer on the James Cameron documentary streaming on Netflix, The Game Changers, about the world's top athletes fueling their victories through plant-based eating.Also joining the company from Impossible Foods, Pavel Aronov, will lead chemistry and analytics to define what supercharges taste and flavor in new products on a molecular level.

The platform has been in closed alpha for several months. The latest round will allow the company to launch the platform to the public later this year. Dorian was created by an experienced team that has come from game-as-a-service and social companies such as Nexon, Pixelberry, Telltale, G5, and Snapchat.""The decentralization of creation has accelerated during the pandemic; the fastest growing apps this year, including Roblox, TikTok, Twitch, and YouTube, are all UGC-driven,"" said Julia Palatovska, CEO of Dorian. ""Users are shifting their attention and support from content to individual creators behind that content. Dorian is in a great position to help fiction writers create engaging interactive experiences and build direct relationships with their audiences.""Dorian's first application is mobile, however its cloud-based engine will allow the company to expand to other emerging platforms and interfaces in the future. Writers can fully customize their characters and instantly see the results of their work without any coding or art skills. Writers who want to build their recognizable brand can upload their own cover art. They can also collaborate with each other in the engine in real-time and share feedback before their content goes live to followers.In tests with about 50,000 players, Dorian has found that writers taking its data-driven suggestions improved monetization by 70 percent only after one or two iterations. Superfans already spend up to $10 per episode. These early numbers indicate that writers will have a much better monetization potential on Dorian than other outlets, where monetization either does not exist or is often limited to subscriptions that bundle multiple authors together.""Dorian's success in creating an interactive platform that values storytelling while prioritizing monetization for its writers is a game-changer,"" said Gregory Milken, Managing Partner, March Capital Partners. ""Julia and her team are creating a community that is primed to capture the attention of today's influential but underrepresented content creators.""In other exciting news, John Howell, former VP of Global Partnerships at Twitch, joins the Dorian board as an independent director. Howell states, ""Writers are the largest creator base in the world, and for too long there's been a gap in their ability to engage with their fans with frequency while simultaneously helping them to monetize their work. Dorian helps connect writers with existing fans and new fans while providing tools that allow them to monetize and improve their skillset. Dorian strikes me as a massive opportunity to serve a passionate group of creators and I'm excited to join them on this journey.""Dorian is now accepting new writers to its invite-only beta through applications on its website. Writers who join closed beta will keep the ownership of their content, get a head start with the content creation prior to the launch, and receive proceeds from the revenue share split that will be announced later this year.""We see talent everywhere,"" continued Palatovska. ""Some of our most popular stories were written by creators with zero experience in games. The potential is there for those writers who are genuinely excited about reaching the next generation of readers who expect content to be interactive.""ABOUT DORIAN:Dorian is a smart, no-code platform that allows professional and amateur writers to turn their stories into games, play with friends and earn revenue.

Amplify also participated in the Series B.Managing Director of Felicis Ventures, Sundeep Peechu will join Amplify General Partner Sunil Dhaliwal on the PicnicHealth board. The investment comes on the heels of PicnicHealth's recently-announced partnership with Roche and Genentech. Several of the world's largest biopharma companies already rely on PicnicHealth for data that powers their medical research.""Our mission at Felicis is to invest in companies that reinvent critical markets such as healthcare research,"" said Sundeep Peechu. ""PicnicHealth embodies this approach, as it is poised to make a massive impact on our ability to treat chronic disease.""PicnicHealth was founded to help patients with chronic or complex illnesses gain control of their medical records so they can more effectively navigate their healthcare journeys. To date, PicnicHealth has helped tens of thousands of patients by porting their records from any doctor or EMR in the United States into a single, secure online account. In July, PicnicHealth announced the launch of the PicnicHealth Research Platform, which allows patients to give consent to share their de-identified data with researchers. PicnicHealth is able to provide uniquely rich data for research because it works directly with patients and has a scalable data structuring pipeline built on human-in-the-loop machine learning. The result is the first fully patient-consented real world data set that gives a complete view of each patient's journey over time and across all of their different medical providers.""PicnicHealth started as a way to give patients more control navigating their own care,"" said Noga Leviner, CEO PicnicHealth, who founded PicnicHealth after managing a Crohn's disease diagnosis. ""We quickly realized we were actually solving a much bigger problem by turning each patient's messy, dispersed data into structured data. The result not only helps patients directly but it also really moves the needle on research.""Working with patients to enable better data at scalePicnicHealth works directly with patients to give them the only tool anywhere that truly provides all of their medical records from any doctor or healthcare system in the US-in an easy-to-use, secure online dashboard. Not only that, but patients can choose to contribute their incredibly important data to scientific research, which helps life sciences companies accelerate breakthroughs in care.PicnicHealth has created a scalable way to transform very messy, often unstructured data into normalized, structured data. For patients, this means they can see and share records easily with their doctors and caregivers. For researchers, they gain access to data they can't get anywhere else. Because healthcare records are full of unstructured text and don't yet have interoperable standards, this is a difficult technical challenge. The company has created a solution to collect records at scale, use ML to structure data from those records, and then leverage clinicians to ensure accuracy where algorithms on their own fall short of rigorous regulatory and clinical standards. The resulting data both trains PicnicHealth's ML models and is truly useful for patients and research alike.Using aggregated, de-identified data, PicnicHealth gives researchers a uniquely rich view of how diseases are experienced by patients and treated by clinicians in the real world, well beyond the highly controlled setting of clinical trials. This is useful for understanding things like outcomes across underrepresented groups, treatment patterns outside of academic centers where most research happens, and how disease symptoms change for different groups over their lifetimes. For researchers, the lack of access to this data has historically slowed efforts to create better treatments that can ultimately improve patient outcomes.""PicnicHealth stands alone in the real world evidence market by providing transformative value to patients with chronic conditions and to researchers working on cutting-edge treatments,"" said Sunil Dhaliwal, General Partner of Amplify Partners. ""We were thrilled to partner with the founders early in their journey, and are equally excited to partner once again in support of their explosive growth.""Investing in team and platform to support more disease areasPicnicHealth will use the new funding to move into new disease areas, expanding access to the platform to more patients, while building new research data sets. The company will also focus on building engineering, machine learning, and clinical informatics capacity to scale its regulatory-grade data pipeline.Upcoming hiring builds on two recent additions to company leadership: Richard Kho, Ph.D., joins as Chief Commercial Officer and Luna Federici joins as Chief Operating Officer. Dr. Kho leads PicnicHealth's commercial organization and its partnerships with life sciences, payers, and academic research organizations. He joins from Komodo Health, where he served as Chief Revenue Officer, and brings 20 years of life sciences experience, including roles at Amgen and Genentech.

An estimated 3.4 million Americans currently live with epilepsy and there are 1 million refractory individuals who do not respond to anti-seizure medications. Epilepsy is a chronic disorder, the hallmark of which is recurrent, unprovoked seizures. More people live with epilepsy than autism spectrum disorder, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy - combined.3About the RNSÂ® SystemThe RNS System is the world's first and only closed-loop brain-responsive neurostimulation system designed to prevent epileptic seizures at their source. The RNS System treats seizures by continuously monitoring brain waves, recognizing each patient's unique ""seizure onset fingerprint,"" and automatically responding with imperceptible electrical pulses before seizures occur. Physicians can view their patient's EEG data on a secure website and program the device to personalize therapy for each individual. Unlike anti-epileptic drugs or resective surgery, neuromodulation outcomes typically improve with time and do not cause the cognitive side effects that can be associated with those alternatives. The RNS System is now available at most comprehensive epilepsy centers in the United States and is widely covered by insurance.The RNSÂ® System is an adjunctive therapy for adults with refractory, focal onset seizures with no more than 2 epileptogenic foci.

Crowdz has raised to-date $9.1M in funding, led by Bold Capital Partners, with investment from Augment Ventures and TFX Capital building on $6.1 million led by Barclays bank & Bold last year. The round comes as Crowdz reports 5000 percent growth in business users, accelerated by a surge in demand to improve cash flow, due to COVID-19.  Crowdz, which provides a marketplace for businesses to sell unpaid invoices to investors in exchange for cash, has seen a surge in demand from small businesses in need of urgent funding due to the pandemic shutdowns, as an alternative or in addition to the SBA's controversial Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, or traditional bank loans.  The company will use the funding to bolster its product roadmap and launch globally, with the UK in its immediate sights. Crowdz CEO and founder Payson Johnston said the invoice financing would become a vital part of the recovery process for businesses post COVID-19, with government assistance over-exhausted and risk appetite from banks non-existent. ""Unpaid and late invoices cost SMEs as much as $3 trillion annually, with cash flow issues the leading cause of business failure. We know in ordinary circumstances, 78 percent of accounts payable departments admit to paying invoices late, let alone during a pandemic.""  ""For the millions of business owners around the world who have spent decades of their lives and their savings building their businesses, only to be wiped out in a matter of weeks, Crowdz is able to provide a lifeline where governments and banks cannot. Government loans like PPP were too hard to access, or the terms of forgiveness were out of reach for the smallest of businesses with surmounting expenses,"" said Johnston.  ""With support from some outstanding investors, plus a raft of new strategic partnerships, Crowdz plans to help SMEs hardest hit by COVID-19 get back on their feet. More broadly,  this new investment round will enable us to increase our capacity to fund more businesses, enabling us to make the market more efficient, reduce the risk of a COVID-19 credit bubble, and most importantly, help to rebuild the economy,"" he said.   New products to support a new post-COVID economy to support rapid growth As more SMEs than ever seek financing, Crowdz' product roadmap will be tailored towards supporting SME growth, as well as delivering value to the enterprise and investors, with new offerings.  This will include  Crowdz' proprietary SMART Score, the market's most accurate, real-time risk assessment, with a number of inputs such as Edward Altman's famed Z-Score* and Probability of Default, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reputational risk. The product will be available in 2021 as a standalone offering to enable funders, banks, and enterprises to track the risk of buying receivables and monitor real-time risk in supply chains. Crowdz is further expanding its offering to support alternative revenue streams, including its whitelabel offering -  Supply Chain Finance as a Service (SCFaaS). Crowdz' will also continue to grow its in-house finance facility, which it launched during the pandemic to make a return on invoices within its marketplace, by fully funding, or part-funding alongside other investors on the platform. Teymour Boutros-Ghali, Managing Partner of BOLD Capital Partners, said ""Given the state of global economies, and the growing need for alternative sources of finance, especially for SMEs, this is clearly an industry that is ripe for disruption. We believe Crowdz has the expertise to accomplish that. ""The company has shown it has the capacity to build out enterprise accounts, start pushing on big international deals and expand teams. Our goal is to ensure they have the ability to accelerate their burn rate to achieve this growth,"" he said. The announcement builds on Crowdz' latest partnerships which include integrations with Inuit Quickbooks, Zoho Books and Xero. The company has also been admitted as a member of the COVID-19 Fintech Taskforce, responding to the urgent need for financial support from UK SMEs impacted by the pandemic, as well as a participant in the UK's FCA Sandbox testing.

The brand took off, becoming a poster child of the e-commerce movement that would spawn many a ""Warby Parker of X""s.

The smart technology device solves the most significant issue with birth control pills women face - pill adherence. The Emme Smart Case is now available for purchase at www.emme.com, and the Emme Pill and Health tracking app is available in the App Store.The company also announced $2.5M in seed funding led by Magnetic Ventures with participation from existing investors. The firm's founding partner, Christine Aylward, joined the board, along with experienced healthcare innovator and Evidation CEO Deborah Kilpatrick. Christine and Deborah bring to Emme extensive experience in the medical device, digital health, and pharmaceutical industries.Approximately 10 million women use the pill in the United States each year for contraception and health management. While the pill should be taken on time every day to be effective, 80% of women miss at least one pill per month. ""Emme is the first company to offer a comprehensive and complete birth control solution,"" said Christine Aylward, Founder and Managing Partner of Magnetic Ventures. ""Many companies deliver pills, but no other company can tell you when to take the pill, and when you should use back-up contraception to help avoid getting pregnant. It may seem simple to be compliant with pill management - but pregnancy rates while on the oral contraception prove it's not.""People on the pill currently rely on memory, alarms, or apps. Unfortunately, missed pills are prevalent with these solutions because they are subject to user error and alarm fatigue. Motivated to solve this pressing healthcare issue, Amanda French and Janene Fuerch, MD, co-founded Emme in 2017 during their fellowship at Stanford Byers Center for Biodesign. ""Missed pills result in nearly one million unplanned pregnancies in the United States each year. They also disrupt hormone balance causing side effects such as bleeding, nausea, mood changes, and headaches,"" French shared. ""After hearing stories from hundreds of women about the stress of the pill, I knew we could help improve the effectiveness of the pill by solving the problem of adherence with technology."" Emme offers the first integrated system, which removes the burden of remembering to take the pill and notifies at-risk users when back-up contraception is needed. The Emme Smart Case is compatible with more than 100 brands of birth control pills and uses patent-pending, multi-sensor technology to track when pills are taken. The smart case syncs with the app to send persistent customized reminders until the dose is taken and provides relevant health information. Users can also manage their cycles with tracking for mood, symptoms, and side effects. In beta testing, the Emme Smart Case and app drove an 80% reduction in missed pills, while 85% of participants reported improved confidence with the pill.""Technology has evolved rapidly in the past decade,"" said French. ""It is exciting we can now apply smart technology to improve the pill's effectiveness for millions of women to help solve the industry-wide challenge of pill adherence.About Emme:Emme is a healthcare technology company with a mission to put women's health in women's hands, starting with birth control.

The company's forthcoming app and readiness platform will provide a simple, relatable way to assess and develop preparedness and gain peace-of-mind. By curating expert advice and personalizing, automating, and gamifying key aspects of home safety, harbor aims to make getting ready for the unexpected a fun and easy part of everyday habits.harbor launches at a time when Americans are experiencing the acute impacts of climate change and other disruptions, including an increased frequency and severity of disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, storms and drought. In 2019 alone, the U.S. experienced an historic 14 ""billion-dollar"" climate events. Between 2014 and 2019, 97 percent of Americans were affected by some kind of natural disaster, yet only 2 percent were prepared for these types of events. Beyond wildfires and hurricanes, every second in the U.S. there is a house fire, and 60% of home fire deaths involve missing or malfunctioning smoke detectors. The pandemic's impact on our lives has only reinforced how ill-prepared Americans are.That's why harbor is launching a platform that guides and automates the preparedness process for you, combining planning with vital information that will enable families to stay calm and safe before, during, and after any disruption. harbor wants to help families cultivate ""household wellness"": the concept of forming everyday habits to keep your home and family safe.harbor has scanned hundreds of millions of data points from federal agencies like NOAA, FEMA, and USGS as well as land maps and building codes to pinpoint individual household risk. harbor then provides steps people can take on a regular basis to increase their preparedness, and stay informed with real-time updates and advice when disasters hit.Dan Kessler, a former Headspace executive, was appointed as CEO in January. Kessler brings over 15 years of experience in consumer internet technologies and subscription businesses to launch and scale harbor. He served as a VP of global business development at Headspace, where he focused on long-term business growth across the brand's consumer, enterprise and healthcare departments. Before that, he served as SVP of Operations and Strategy at Hallmark, where he drove new strategic initiatives for the company's digital greetings and SVOD service.""I am passionate about the benefits of forming habits that improve everyday life. But even as a huge industry is growing around personal health and wellness, preparing for emergency events is still considered extreme,"" said Kessler. ""The health and safety of your household isn't extreme, and you shouldn't have to be ex-military to be prepared: the unexpected is inevitable and many risks are easily mitigated with the right information. It's incredibly rewarding to reimagine what readiness looks like, and to build something that will help make preparing for unexpected events simple, and managing the hard parts of life a little bit easier.""Dan is joined by Eduardo Fonseca as Chief Technology Officer. Eduardo is an entrepreneur and startup advisor. He was most recently the CTO of GoodRx where he grew the engineering team from eight to close to 100 engineers, led the diligence and integration for three acquisitions, and oversaw complete architectural revamp spanning mobile, backend and frontend. Eduardo has 25+ years of experience in software engineering and 15+ years of leadership experience.The company is also announcing a team of advisors made up of notable experts in climate change, emergency management, and national security. The advisory council includes:Alice Hill, current senior fellow for climate change policy at the Council on Foreign Relations and former senior director for resilience policy on President Obama's National Security CouncilJuliette Kayyem, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and CNN national security analyst who served as Assistant Secretary at the Department of Homeland SecurityBrock Long, Executive Chairman of Hagerty Consulting and a Former Administrator of FEMA from 2017-2019, where he led the nation through 220 declared disasters and wildfiresDeeDee Bennett, assistant professor at SUNY-Albany in the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and CybersecurityLinda Mansollilo, a medical officer in the Air Force Reserve, biotech strategist, founder of LadyBugOut, and instructor for the Defense Institute of Medical Operations (DIMO)Chris Harris, expert in disaster and casualty risk management, former CEO of Montpelier Re Holdings, and former Chairman of Blue Capital Reinsurance.""Climate change is already having a serious impact on our population, including making natural disasters more frequent and severe. We must be resilient in the face of its consequences, both on a macroscale and in our everyday lives,"" said Hill.

PrizePool reimagines savings and creates a new way to incentivize Americans to build a better financial foundation. Launched today, the company announced a seed round of $4.25 million led by Accomplice, Bling Capital, Coatue, SciFi VC, and World Innovation Lab, among others.More than half of Americans do not have the savings to cover an emergency expense of $1000, living paycheck to paycheck with no reserve for 'what if.' However, a majority of Americans spend cash on the lottery every week in the hope of a big win. The actual odds of winning with the lottery and scratch cards are very low. Still, people in the United States spent more than $91 billion on lottery tickets in 2019, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries.""Now more than ever, Americans need to be saving money to protect their future,"" said Frank Chien, co-founder and CEO of PrizePool. ""But we know that saving can be hard to prioritize, and our goal is to reduce the barrier to saving money by making it fun in two unique ways. First, we guarantee a total of $50,000 in real cash prizes every month, and second, our referral program makes saving a social activity -- so that you can save and win together."" Chien and his co-founder, Joe Woo, sold their first company, LearnSprout, to Apple in 2015.Guaranteed Monthly Prizes that total $50,000PrizePool ups the game of today's boring, low-growth, savings accounts. It gives customers a new, fun place to save -- one where their money is their chance to win real cash prizes guaranteed to total $50,000 every month. PrizePool pays out a $25,000 Grand Prize each month, along with thousands of smaller prizes. A new model of prize-linked savings, PrizePool feeds the desire that people have 'to play and win' but does so as they save, at no cost or risk to customers. All deposits are FDIC insured, by Evolve Bank & Trust, and there are no fees and no minimums to participate.Referral ProgramPrizePool's unique referral program is designed to transform saving money from a solitary act to a shared, social, and even more rewarding experience. The program lets people save together with friends and family. When a PrizePool user refers a friend, there are shared benefits: they inspire each other to save more, and they increase their chances of winning together.How it works - once users sign up for PrizePool, they can refer friends and family to join and save. When a user refers a friend, they both win a 10% bonus when the friend wins a prize - the friend receives an extra 10% boost for using the first customer's referral code and the original user gets a bonus of 10% of their friend's winnings too. These bonus prizes are incentives to save and play together.""When I met Frank and Joe, the founders, and saw their track record in tech and education, I knew they were serious about looking to build a business with the goal of getting people to focus on their financial lives in a unique and engaging way,"" said Andy Chen, Partner, Coatue. ""We believe this experience combined with the commitments to both guarantee monthly prizes and create a social, referral model sets PrizePool apart from others in the market.""""We have been big fans of prize-linked savings for a long time, and believe it has the potential to reshape savings habits in America. We're glad to have found an excellent team to execute on this,"" said Nellie and Max Levchin, Partners at SciFi VC.

In the first flight, the pilot pressed a button on a remote user interface and the unmanned four passenger Cessna 172 Skyhawk (C172) automatically taxied, took off, and landed. Most recently, the company demonstrated fully automated remote landing of an even larger aircraft, the Cessna 208 Caravan (C208), capable of carrying 14 passengers.""Automated aircraft are going to fundamentally shift the entire airline business, and Reliable Robotics is well positioned to be a key player in this new market. The progress their team has demonstrated in a short amount of time is very impressive,"" said David Neeleman, Founder of five commercial airlines including JetBlue Airways.Reliable Robotics seamlessly integrated its autonomous platform onto the 2,550 pound C172. They began the C172 program in January 2018 and completed fully automated gate-to-gate operation before the end of that year. Extensive system safety analysis and testing was conducted prior to the unmanned test flight in September 2019. This marked the first time a privately funded company operated a passenger airplane of this type with no pilot on board over a populated region, and was an important step in certifying the autonomous platform for repeated, safe civil use on certified aircraft.""We spent the first portion of our flight test program focused on the C172. We thoroughly tested every aspect of our system in simulation and conducted rigorous safety checks before operating the aircraft without a pilot on board and are now proud to share what we've been working on,"" said Robert Rose, Co-founder and CEO of Reliable Robotics. ""By bringing advanced automation to aviation, we will deliver higher safety, reliability and convenience for cargo operators and eventually for passengers.""The company designed and built a proprietary autonomous platform that can be applied to any fixed-wing aircraft. The platform includes avionics, software, mechanisms, a communications system, remote command interfaces, along with a backup system that has the capability to take over if needed. Following the C172 program, it was adapted for use on the larger C208. Reliable Robotics is now working with the FAA on incrementally bringing this technology to market, having already demonstrated automated landing on the C208 last month.""Reliable Robotics has assembled a proven team with deep experience across aviation, aerospace, self driving cars, medical devices and robotics.

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) and the growing sophistication of malware have given well-funded, state-sponsored cyber attackers the upper hand in stealing valuable information and compromising government and commercial systems.The investment reflects strong validation of AffirmLogic's cutting-edge Hyperion technology, seasoned management team and expanding global market opportunities.National Security RootsThe genesis of AffirmLogic traces back to research at Carnegie Mellon University on a radical new way to automate the analysis of software. Working together, mathematicians, cybersecurity experts and computer scientists recognized that this mathematical approach, known as Behavior Computation, was a breakthrough in detecting malicious operations hidden inside software programs.Carnegie Mellon's cutting-edge research led to the development of the initial version of Hyperion as part of a national security project. The technology was further evolved at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Realizing the potential of Hyperion, the Department of Homeland Security selected it for DHS's Transition to Practice (TTP) Program, designed to move innovative technologies from national laboratories into broader use through commercialization and adoption by end-users. Hyperion was extensively vetted by expert cybersecurity teams in the government and business communities and then licensed to AffirmLogic to commercialize the technology.Technology InnovationWhile techniques for malware detection have evolved in recent years, they fall short in identifying more recent cybersecurity threats such as Zero-Day attacks and APTs. Hyperion applies Behavior Computation to detect, analyze and defend against even the most sophisticated, potentially devastating forms of cyberattack. Hyperion empowers malware experts, Computer Emergency Readiness Teams (CERT), Reverse Engineers (RE) and Computer Network Defense (CND) analysts to dramatically reduce the time it takes to identify and protect against cyberattacks.Seasoned Leadership TeamThe AffirmLogic management team has decades of experience in advanced research and software engineering, as well as in building and growing market-leading companies. AffirmLogic's leadership team includes:Larry Roshfeld, CEO, an experienced senior executive who has served in CXO and executive positions for several successful software startups, including Riverbed Technologies, Approva, CorasWorks, Sonatype and Lumeon.Richard Linger, CTO, the co-inventor of the Hyperion technology. Richard served in key technical roles at IBM and the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute (CERT), where he developed theoretical foundations and implementation of Function Extraction (FX) technology for automated computation of software behavior. Linger continued to evolve the technology as a Senior Researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.Bill Yarnoff, Chief Growth Officer, an enterprise and public sector technology veteran who most recently led the formation and launch of the ACEL360 accelerator for federal government contractors.""Our ability to mathematically compute the behavior of software is a game-changer for organizations that demand greater visibility into malware and advanced cyber threats.

The financing was led by Viking Global Investors, with participation from other existing investors including Builders VC and Breakout Ventures. Wilbur Ellis's Cavallo Ventures, a new strategic investor in Checkerspot, also participated. Including the Series B, Checkerspot has raised more than $50 million.Throughout many consumer and industrial supply chains, product developers are searching for unique, high-performance materials to help drive revenue growth and product differentiation. This financing provides a strong foundation for Checkerspot to meet the demand for the materials it is commercializing today, as well as the demand for an innovation platform like Checkerspot's that is capable of creating new materials and products across multiple industry segments. Checkerspot's innovation platform allows it to address these markets more sustainably than legacy businesses reliant on petroleum and commodity-scale vegetable oils like palm and soy.Using advanced genomics, biotechnology and biomanufacturing processes, Checkerspot's innovation platform looks to nature's vast array of unexplored molecular building blocks, like fatty acids and triglycerides. These compounds were overlooked because they couldn't be supplied at scale - until now. Checkerspot works with these building blocks to develop and produce structurally unique microalgae oils at scale and then, through chemistry and materials science, rapidly iterates through specific applications to develop materials with targeted features and performance attributes. Checkerspot's first point of entry into the market with outdoor recreation demonstrates how the company can approach product innovation with a new set of tools.Founded in 2016, Checkerspot now has three materials on the market. These include a light-weight urethane-based composite (Algal Core) and a cast urethane (Algal Wall), both of which launched in a backcountry ski application through the outdoor recreation brand WNDRÂ® Alpine. The Algal Core is a composite of vertically laminated materials utilizing a biobased urethane foam with a carbon content of greater than 40% (ASTM D6866). The Algal Wall cast polyurethane sidewalls are made utilizing Checkerspot's proprietary biobased polyurethane, engineered for application-specific physical properties, including greater bondline strength, Shore D Hardness, tensile strength and improved damping. The Algal Wall, with a biobased carbon content of 60% (ASTM D6866), also utilizes a novel manufacturing technique that diverts plastic waste from landfills better than traditional techniques that rely on ABS plastic sidewalls. In partnership with Beyond Surface Technologies (BST), Checkerspot is also commercializing an algal oil formulated into BST's wicking textile finish, MiDoriÂ® BioWick.""We look forward to announcing additional commercial progress, including more strategic partnerships to complement our existing co-development portfolio with W.L. Gore, DIC Corporation and Beyond Surface Technologies. This financing milestone reflects what Checkerspot has accomplished to date, and the whole team is excited about this next phase and this opportunity to deepen our partnership with Viking,"" said Charles Dimmler, CEO and co-founder of Checkerspot.""We are focused on driving both scale and performance in our materials production to meet demand. Our approach to developing new materials always starts with the performance problem we are trying to solve,"" said Scott Franklin, Chief Scientific Officer and co-founder. ""Understanding the genomics of microalgae allows us to connect the world of biotechnology to bespoke materials and high-performance consumer products. Through rapid formulation, fabrication and prototyping, we are able to dial in material performance in products in as little as 72 hours. These materials we are focusing on have wide application potential in a range of industries, and this new funding will allow us to grow our platform and expand our reach into those markets.""About CheckerspotCheckerspot designs performance materials at a molecular level. It does this by optimizing microbes to biomanufacture unique structural oils produced in nature, but not previously accessible at commercial scale. The company is currently commercializing three materials: a light-weight urethane-based composite (Algal Core) and a cast urethane (Algal Wall), both commercialized initially through the brand WNDRÂ® Alpine, as well as algal oil formulated into MiDoriÂ® BioWick and sold in partnership with Beyond Surface Technologies to clothing brands worldwide.

The company was founded based on the insights of Prof. Gideon Gross (Migal Research Institute), who collaborated with Prof. Zelig Eshhar to design the first Chimeric Antigen Receptor technologies for T-cells (CAR T). While CAR-T drugs have provided meaningful breakthroughs for the treatment of some hematologic malignancies, little progress has been made in applying the technology to solid tumors. Such diseases are rarely characterized by the over-expression of tumor-selective antigens, but genomic analyses have revealed many mechanisms for loss of expression.Founder Prof. Gideon Gross explains ImmPACT's origins by observing, ""Engineered cells have progressed tremendously in lymphomas and leukemias, in large part because lymphocytes have very selective targets. We will need new targeting strategies to tackle solid tumors, as few selective targets have been discovered, and antigens are almost always shared by indispensable tissues."" Prof. Gross ultimately realized that, ""Many solid tumors demonstrate genetic losses due to abnormal chromosomal maintenance - a fact that can be utilized to design new types of cellular immuno-oncology drugs.""""We have built a world-class team and a promising pipeline to realize Prof. Gross' vision of targeting loss-of-gene features of solid tumors.

With the new investment, SpyCloud plans to grow its product and engineering teams and build new ways to detect and prevent fraud.""Criminals work together to steal information and find creative ways to monetize it. As a result, even the most careful and sophisticated organizations are vulnerable,"" said Ted Ross, SpyCloud CEO and co-founder. ""SpyCloud will continue to pursue new and innovative ways to stay ahead of criminals and provide solutions that make the internet a safer place for individuals and businesses.""The COVID-19 pandemic has given criminals fresh opportunities to exploit internet users. In the early days of the pandemic, SpyCloud researchers uncovered 139,000 new web domains related to the virus and multiple scams being used to take advantage of people, such as criminals posing as government agencies and perpetrating credential stuffing attacks on food delivery apps. Since then, the company has continued to identify emerging threats and track increased malicious activity correlated to the timeline of the pandemic.""SpyCloud's approach to fraud prevention is helping businesses protect themselves and their customers at a time when threats are more pervasive than we've ever seen.

""We're proud to help them continue the fight and discover new ways to protect both companies and consumers from these evolving threats.""""With so many people now working from home and multiple family members sharing devices with a mix of personal and professional applications, attack surfaces have increased significantly. Criminals are certainly taking full advantage of these new opportunities to exploit your employees and their family members,"" Ross said. ""SpyCloud is dedicated to protecting everyone from attacks and preventing them before they happen.""Account takeover is one of the most common methods for criminals to gain access to sensitive personal and corporate information. They acquire credentials stolen in data breaches and use them to commit fraud and business email compromise, siphon off financial information and intellectual property, and then package them for sale on underground markets.

The company also announced today that employee benefits leader Brian Marcotte has joined the Carrot board. Most recently, Brian served as the President & CEO of Business Group on Health for nearly a decade before retiring in May 2020.

The latest round, led by Axioma Ventures, was joined by all existing investors, including veteran investor Jeff Vinik, and brings Bridge Connector's total funding to over $45 million. After achieving over 1000% year-over-year growth in 2019, the investment will further support the company's increasing market share in health care interoperability and growth of Destinations, a new integration-platform-as-a-service (iPaaS) that connects health data systems using use-case-based interoperability blueprints to speed integrations with major vendors.Bridge Connector provides a suite of vendor-agnostic integration solutions and a full-service delivery model, helping health care vendors, providers, and payers more easily share data between disparate systems, such as electronic health records (EHRs) or patient engagement solutions. The company's technology is designed to democratize health care by allowing organizations of any size to equitably connect data systems and empower care teams with the most accurate patient data in real-time. Unlike other health care interoperability vendors, Bridge Connector's unique approach does not lock customers into a forced data model or proprietary APIs, instead employing a vendor-agnostic integration layer that works across data models without the need for standardization.""The level of support we have received from our investors and key partners demonstrates the disruptive power of what we are doing,"" said Bridge Connector Founder and CEO, David Wenger. ""The lack of integration in health care has resulted in care teams relying on antiquated technology like fax machines to relay mission-critical information. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has never been clearer that this inability to share patient data between health care technology vendors creates dangerous care gaps that can mean the difference between life and death for some patients. Bridge Connector is building an ecosystem of connected solutions that is solving this problem.""The last decade has seen an explosion of digital health platforms and the U.S. health care system has taken incremental steps toward achieving interoperability between them. In March, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued new rules that force formerly closed vendor solutions to become interoperable. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the urgent need for data liquidity as health care providers across the country have struggled to share essential patient information and provide comprehensive care via remote delivery methods such as telehealth. In the face of the pandemic's disproportionate effect on minority communities, the industry has also recognized the critically important role that social determinants of health -- the environments in which we are born, live and work -- play in our overall well-being and the need to make this information available to health care providers.""We believed strongly in Bridge Connector's mission to improve interoperability in health care when we made our seed investment, and they've exceeded all of our expectations along the way,"" said Howard Jenkins, former CEO of Publix Super Markets, and co-founding partner of Axioma Ventures, which has participated in each of Bridge Connector's funding rounds. ""The company's growth in the two years since has validated our belief in the technology and brightened the outlook for an interoperable health care system. With the company on track for 800 to 1000% growth in 2020, we are eager to see how our continued investment will help Bridge Connector impact the industry and create a health care system that works better for patients.""The new funding comes shortly after Bridge Connector finalized various collaborations with some of the most influential stakeholders in health IT, including Epic, Allscripts and Salesforce, as well as other system integrators such as MuleSoft. Those collaborations represent calculated steps toward creating a centralized hub of integration solutions for all data platforms that any health care provider or payer can access. The average hospital today uses approximately 16 disparate electronic health records platforms that limit data sharing within the walls of a single hospital, let alone between separate hospitals.To learn more about Bridge Connector's solutions for achieving health care interoperability, please visit https://bridgeconnector.co/.About Bridge ConnectorBridge Connector is an interoperability company changing the way health care communicates.

As a part of the investment, Ralph Lauren will help scale NFW's patented process and develop first-of-its-kind performance apparel made from natural, sustainable materials.""We have evolved and progressed our business for more than 50 years because we constantly push ourselves to think openly and differently about how to approach challenges,"" said David Lauren, Vice Chairman & Chief Innovation Officer at Ralph Lauren. ""Today, sustainability is an area where this is especially important, and investing with partners to scale innovative solutions is a key part of our sustainability strategy. We are excited to support the work of NFW, a pioneer in this field. Their technology has the power to not only advance our work at Ralph Lauren, but effect positive change across the entire industry.""Recycled cotton is often unsuitable for use in new cotton apparel due to the short fibers created during recycling. Founded in 2015, NFW has solved this challenge with an innovative process that welds short fibers into longer fibers to create high-performance cotton yarns which can incorporate cotton and other plant-based waste fibers. This patented process transforms these materials in ways that were never possible before, creating an opportunity to reuse post-consumer cotton waste and impart performance characteristics into the fiber. The resulting upcycled material outperforms synthetic fabrics while still retaining the comfortable feel of cotton. ""We are thrilled to have the investment, support and insight of Ralph Lauren, an industry icon whose commitment to timelessness - to true sustainability - is central to who they are,"" said Dr. Luke Haverhals, Founder and CEO at NFW.

The new venture will focus on innovation in vegetable varieties with the goal of lifting the vertical farming space to the next level of quality, efficiency and sustainability.While most start-ups in the vertical farming market are focusing on the development of more efficient infrastructure, Unfold is the only company with unparalleled assets to unlock the genetic potential of vertical farming. By utilizing the seed genetics (germplasm) from vegetable crops, Unfold will focus on developing new seed varieties coupled with agronomic advice tailored for the unique indoor environment of vertical farms.Unfold raised USD 30 million in the initial funding round and entered into an agreement for certain rights to germplasm from Bayer's vegetable portfolio.""Innovation that offers sustainable solutions for agriculture is one of the 10 areas of engagement and investment that Leaps by Bayer is focused on,"" said JÃ¼rgen Eckhardt, Head of Leaps by Bayer, which was built to drive fundamental breakthroughs in the fields of health and agriculture through new technologies. ""The investment in Unfold is a great example of a transformative, creative approach to developing agricultural products that meets the needs of consumers, farmers and the planet by increasing access to fresh fruits and vegetables, supporting sustainably grown, hyperlocal production and addressing food security challenges faced by growing urban populations.""The investment aligns with Bayer's vision of Health for All and Hunger for None, a commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals the United Nations has set for 2030, especially the goals of assuring healthy lifestyles and putting an end to hunger.Vertical farms, also known as indoor farms or plant facilities with artificial light (PFAL), utilize indoor growing facilities that leverage artificial light, reduce dependency on synthetic chemistry and other crop inputs, optimize water use and allow food growth in challenging environments with limited arable land. Vertical farms help crops grow more quickly, enabling the reliable growth of fresh, local produce anywhere, anytime utilizing less space and fewer natural resources while reducing the need for food logistics and transportation. Unfold will support the hyperlocal production of consumer-pleasing vegetables while also addressing the increasing need for a reliable and safe supply of sustainably grown produce, especially in food deserts and in times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.Investment in the vertical farming market has increased significantly in recent years mainly due to decreasing arable land, increasing market demand for local, sustainable produce and migration towards mega-cities.Singapore, where Temasek is headquartered, is one of many mega-cities experiencing an increasing demand for fresh, sustainable and locally grown produce that has a smaller environmental footprint, using fewer resources to grow and ship, offering peak freshness and flavor.""The global food challenges we increasingly face require us to rethink traditional farming practices. We need to ensure secure farm-to-fork supply chains in urban settings while we also work to reduce the overall environmental impact of farming. Reducing food waste and improving the safety, traceability and nutritional value of food are all the more important as populations grow and demands for food expand,"" said John Vaske, Head of Agribusiness at Temasek. ""Investments in companies such as Unfold allow us and our partners to support innovative, sustainable solutions that will benefit all of us over the long term.""Led by CEO John Purcell, Unfold will be a U.S. entity headquartered in the Davis, Calif. area with commercial and research and development operations in both California and Singapore.""What sets Unfold apart is its unparalleled investment in germplasm and crop growth models best suited for vertical farming environments, an area currently largely underserved,"" said Purcell. ""As a company fully focused on the vertical farming industry, Unfold will combine leading seed genetics with the best agtech experts in order to dramatically advance productivity, flavor and other consumer preferences. We look forward to serving the market through partnerships with vertical farming operators, technology providers and others across the produce supply chain.""About BayerBayer is a global enterprise with core competencies in the life science fields of health care and nutrition.

Micronoma has exclusively licensed the original IP on microbial-based cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, created by Poore and Knight, from UC San Diego.Micronoma's technology has shown that distinct cancer types can be diagnosed sensitively and specifically solely using microbial nucleic acids in human blood and tissues. This approach was first demonstrated using a cancer sequencing database of >10,000 patients from 32 cancer types, then validated on >150 real-world patient samples from Moore's Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health, across three cancer types and comparing results to those from healthy, non-cancer controls.  The results of the study were published in Nature in March 2020.While Micronoma's method is capable of querying more than one cancer type in a single small blood sample, the company will first focus on the early detection of lung cancer. Despite its high prevalence and mortality rate, lung cancer has remained challenging to detect at an early stage, including recent liquid biopsy methods focusing on cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) or methylation-based methods.""Micronoma is the only company of its kind that uses the individual's microbiome data to detect lung cancer in its early stages, so this first seed funding is a major milestone for our company,"" said Sandrine Miller-Montgomery, CEO of Micronoma. ""Between the technical expertise and business acumen of our founding teams and the strong initial financial support of our investors, we are now ready to expeditiously develop and commercialize our first assay, with an overall aim to decrease the number of preventable deaths from disease.""The funding will also enable Micronoma to start development work and the creation of their CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) lab. The goal is to provide this new diagnostic to clinicians within the next two years.""Advances in understanding the microbiome in recent years have led us to better understand its importance in the environment and human health in general. We are now applying this knowledge to cancer diagnostics in order to make a dent in the four-million lives lost a year to preventable cancer death,"" said Knight. ""By offering a novel set of biomarkers from the microbiome found in a simple blood draw, we have a potential new option for early detection. With early detection comes the prospect for early treatment with a better outcome for the patient and all involved.""For more information, please visit Micronoma.com.About MicronomaMicronoma is the first cancer-detection company using liquid biopsy technology to detect and predict cancer by interrogating the microbial signal with clinical-grade accuracy at an early stage of the disease.

Its clients include Walmart, Wayfair, Ibex Global and many others.""American families are facing more financial stress than they have in generations,"" said Safwan Shah, CEO and Co-Founder of PayActiv. ""The timing gap between work and wages is the main reason workers get hit with punitive late fees, overdraft fees and other penalties. Cumulatively, these fees reduce wages by seven percent every month. The PayActiv platform is the only system where everyone wins: employers lift worker morale with little to no cost and huge dividends; employees get wages when they actually need them most; and cash re-enters the economy faster, making communities financially healthier."" A recent PayActiv study conducted since the outbreak of COVID-19 found that 82% of workers are more worried about financial issues than their health. In addition, 58% of workers have seen their expenses increase during this time.Employers have found that when PayActiv's technology is implemented into their payment services, on average they have shown reduced turnover of their workforce by 25% to 31%. This correlation has led to new business partnerships with ADP and Paychex, among others.""The future of pay is not a two-week cycle,"" said Todd Boehly, Co-founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Eldridge. ""By simply giving people access to their wages as they earn them, PayActiv increases the velocity of money, stimulating the economy and serving employers and employees by driving costs down and efficiencies up.""As a standalone ready-to-use mobile app, PayActiv provides the funds for earned wage access. According to PayActiv's research, the average American worker can save $250 every month by tapping into earned wages and avoiding the fees associated with alternative financing sources.A certified B Corp and Public Benefit Company, PayActiv offers industry-leading flexibility in how users access their cash, including through direct cash pickup, PayActiv prepaid card, instant Visa or Mastercard debit card load, ACH payment, or by using wages to pay bills, make purchases on Amazon, or purchase rides on Uber.

(doing its reinsurance business as HSCM Bermuda), Flourish Ventures, QED, Alpha Edison, Allegis NL Capital, Avanta Ventures (venture arm of CSAA Insurance Group, a AAA Insurer), August Capital, the University of Chicago via its Startup Investment Program, and others.This round brings Kin's total funding to date to $86 million. The investment comes less than a year after Kin received regulatory approval for the Kin Interinsurance Network (KIN), its reciprocal exchange - a form of insurance company that shares underwriting profits with customers. With its latest round of funding, the company plans to bring its solution, piloted in Florida, to homeowners across the U.S., starting with states most affected by severe weather.""We believe in creating meaningful change for homeowners who need our solution the most,"" said Sean Harper, Kin's CEO and co-founder. ""Since we established our carrier last summer, we have been able to innovate much faster because we depend less on legacy insurance infrastructure.""Whereas legacy insurers rely on outdated, inflexible technology, Kin's proprietary platform allows the company to develop and launch new products in as little as a week, price risks in real time, and ingest more data than competitors. Kin's technology also reduces general and administrative expenses, which constitute roughly 15 percent of premiums at legacy homeowner's insurance companies.Kin also differs from legacy companies by selling its products directly to consumers rather than through outside agents. Traditional insurers spend about 17 percent of premiums paying outside agents and maintaining the infrastructure to support them. By selling directly to consumers, Kin eliminates those costs.""As early investors in Kin, we're excited to see how fast the company has grown from startup into a market-leader for directly marketed homeowner's insurance,"" said Dan Rosen, founder of Commerce Ventures. ""While many insurers spend much of their gross margin paying third-party agents, Kin has eliminated those costs, thus making the experience both simpler and more affordable for customers.""By structuring as a reciprocal exchange, Kin has aligned interests with policyholders. Because policyholders actually own the exchange, they benefit when claims are low and have a voice in what the company does.""We are excited to increase our investment in Kin and to continue to support the company's mission to provide simple and affordable insurance coverage to homeowners,"" said Andrew Sagon, Vice President with HSCM Bermuda. ""Kin's leadership team has done a commendable job of transferring structural efficiency gains to its customers in the form of more affordable coverage, and we are thrilled to support Kin's efforts as the business enters its next phase of growth.""Kin's web and mobile platform transforms the process of securing home insurance, making insurance more accessible than ever. This creates an insurance experience that is fast, easy, and driven by customer care.""Avanta Ventures, the venture capital arm of CSAA Insurance Group, is excited to invest and partner with Kin Insurance that is successfully leveraging technology, data, and analytics to better understand risk and underwriting for homeowners insurance to benefit members,"" said Sanjiv Parikh, managing partner at Avanta Ventures.""Kin is the insurance company that all the incumbents want to be,"" said Emmalyn Shaw, Managing Partner of Flourish Ventures. ""With a relentless focus on customer needs and outstanding business execution, the A-rated company now offers the lowest-cost, most customizable products on the market and boasts an impressive NPS of 84, which is about double the industry average.

2020-08-12 00:00:00,Allergy Amulet Secures $3.3M Seed Funding,https://vcnewsdaily.com/allergy-amulet/venture-capital-funding/pxslymqpbd,"MADISON, WI, Allergy Amulet has announced $3.3 million in seed funding led by TitletownTech.",Madison,WI,https://vcnewsdaily.com/Allergy%20Amulet/venture-funding.php,"Allergy Amulet, the company empowering the food allergy community by alleviating fears about what's in their food, today announces $3.3 million in seed funding led by TitletownTech, a joint venture between Microsoft and the Green Bay Packers. The company has developed the world's smallest and fastest consumer food allergen sensor, which is capable of testing foods for common allergenic ingredients in seconds. The patented technology fits on a keychain, a necklace, a wristband, or in a pocket, and doubles as a medical alert system, making it easier and safer to manage food allergies and intolerances.Food allergies affect 32 million Americans and between 220 to 520 million people globally-that's one in 13 children and one in 10 adults. They can be fatal, even after ingesting only trace amounts of a known allergen.Allergy Amulet helps:Individuals with food allergies: It makes testing for food allergens easy, giving people additional assurances that their food is safe.Parents with children who have food allergies: It gives parents another tool to manage their children's allergies, and helps children live a normal childhood, maintain independence, and safely attend sleepovers and birthday parties (or just school) with friends.Businesses: It gives restaurant owners, schools, childcare providers, summer camps, and hotels the power of extra precaution to save them time, money, and worry.""The current standard of care -- avoiding certain foods, injecting epinephrine to treat reactions, and visiting the emergency room -- can take a serious emotional, financial, and physical toll on individuals, caregivers, and families,"" said Abigail Barnes, Co-founder and CEO of Allergy Amulet. ""Our hope is to help individuals more safely engage in the activities that bring them joy, whether that means going to a restaurant with friends and family or eating a cupcake at a party.""How It WorksThe Allergy Amulet is a fast and portable food allergen and ingredient sensor, designed to fit every lifestyle. Its first-of-its-kind detection platform pairs molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) technology with a conductive electrochemical platform to detect target allergenic ingredients. The Amulet consists of two parts: a USB-sized reader (the ""Amulet"") and a test strip that houses the proprietary sensor chips. The case also accommodates epinephrine and antihistamines, giving users a complete allergy care management platform.For consumers, testing for food allergens is made possible in four simple steps:Step 1: Users collect a sample of the food with the test strip, and turn the top of the tester to grind the sample.Step 2: A chip slides out from the test strip and is inserted into the reader.Step 3: Test results appear on the reader within seconds, indicating the presence or absence of the target allergen.Step 4: Optional: store test results in the mobile app, connect and share results with the food allergy community, or hold down a button on the reader to alert your emergency contacts.""Allergy Amulet is not only leading advancements in the field of imprinted sensor technology, they're also spearheading a new product category that will vastly improve the quality of life for millions of individuals with food allergies and intolerances,"" said Neil Mix, partner at TitletownTech. ""Further, we saw the potential for broader food safety applications beyond allergens, including foodborne pathogens and contaminants. This is just the beginning, and we're thrilled to help the team take this on.""The TeamThe Allergy Amulet team has deep connections to the communities they serve -- Barnes has managed life-threatening food allergies since childhood, and experienced a near-fatal anaphylactic event as a teenager. After meeting her Co-founder and Scientific Advisor, Dr. Joseph BelBruno, a Dartmouth chemistry professor emeritus with life-threatening food allergies, the two worked to make Allergy Amulet a reality.The company holds one issued U.S. patent with multiple applications, and its waitlist has thousands of individuals signed up to participate in an early beta release, scheduled to kickoff later this year.This infusion of new capital will be used to manufacture beta units, help to launch pre-orders, expand product offerings to cover more allergens, grow the company's world-class team, add additional restaurant and company partners to its roster, and educate consumers on the benefits of additional food allergen management tools. In addition to Titletown, its seed financing includes participation from Great North Labs, Colle Capital, Great Oaks VC, DeepWork Capital, Dipalo Ventures, and Bulldog Innovation Group.""Allergy Amulet is slated to be the most affordable, fastest, and sleekest food sensor on the market,"" said Barnes. ""We want to build a better future for the food allergy community, because the more tools we have in our toolboxes, the better that future will be.""Allergy Amulet is slated for pre-sales Fall of 2020 and launch Fall of 2021.About Allergy AmuletAllergy Amulet empowers the food allergy community to feel secure in their everyday lives by alleviating fears about what's in their food.

The team believes that inaccessible education is fundamentally a cost problem. Traditional tutoring's high costs are a barrier to entry for students, who wind up feeling neglected by supplementary education systems. GoPeer aimed to solve this problem by recruiting elite college students as educators, tapping into a world of talent. The concept gained widespread praise from families and undergraduates, and GoPeer was born.The Product""If there is one thing we set out to do each and every day, it is building tools that turn our tutors into online teaching superheroes, bringing cost-effective and high-quality education to every kid in the world,"" said Ethan Binder, founder and CEO of GoPeer.Students and tutors communicate through GoPeer's secure online classroom, using tools like real-time face-to-face video conferencing, photo/document sharing, and a virtual whiteboard/notepad to collaborate or edit essays.Over the last three years, GoPeer has met with and spoken with thousands of tutors and students to carefully refine its virtual classroom. From the insights learned, the company has created the most versatile digital classroom that makes online tutoring personalized, effective, and collaborative. With GoPeer, an online tutor offers the same face-to-face personalized tutoring experience as an in-person tutor but uses GoPeer's state-of-the-art live learning platform to meet with students online.Why Parents Love GoPeerParents love the high quality, convenience and cost-effective tutoring that inspires growth, learning and understanding in their children.""Abigail takes the time to make sure my daughter understands concepts behind problems in a way that is supportive and encouraging. Now she's less stressed, more confident, and even got an A on her last exam."" - Liz, Nicole's MomWhy Students Love GoPeerStudents love working with approachable college undergraduates, who can relate to their current perspectives, strategies, and insights.""Katie was honestly an amazing teacher. She not only sent me instructions and tips on how to solve the problems, but she helped diversify my understanding of the problem. As a 9th grader doing Algebra is a little bit frightening, but Katie made it seem very easy and approachable."" - Connor, 9th Grade""GoPeer's mission is to improve the quality and lower the cost of online education,"" said Binder.

The funding round includes returning investors DCVC, BV, Tencent, Y Combinator, Dolby Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, as well as new backing from two top ten global insurance companies. This brings the total amount of capital raised to date to almost $175 million. The company has appointed Raj Ganguly of B Capital Group as a new board member and Hani Enaya of Sanabil as a board observer.""Over the past three years, our platform AtomNetÂ® has tackled - and succeeded - in finding small molecule hits for more undruggable targets than any other AI drug discovery platform,"" said Abraham Heifets, CEO and co-founder of Atomwise. ""With support from our new and existing investment partners, we will be able to leverage this to develop our own pipeline of small molecule drug programs, further grow our portfolio of joint-venture investments, and realize our vision to create better medicines that can improve the lives of billions of people.""With the new investment, Atomwise will continue to scale its AI technology platform and team. The company plans to expand its work with corporate partners, which currently include major players in the biopharma space such as Eli Lilly and Company, Bayer, Hansoh Pharmaceuticals, and Bridge Biotherapeutics, as well as emerging biotechnology companies like StemoniX and SEngine Precision Medicine. Atomwise has signed more than $5.5 billion in total deal value with corporate partners to date.The company will also leverage the financing to build its own internal pipeline tackling historically undruggable and other challenging disease targets. Atomwise will continue to grow its portfolio of joint ventures with leading researchers using AtomNetÂ® for drug discovery, like those it has launched with X-37, Atropos Therapeutics, Theia Biosciences and vAIrus, with a goal to commercialize high potential candidates through the drug development process.Atomwise created the first convolutional neural networks (CNN) for drug discovery, and since its founding in 2012 has continually developed and improved its AI-based drug discovery technology. The company's AI technology has been used by academic researchers at institutes around the world and drug developers - including top-100 pharmaceutical and emerging biotechnology companies, a rapidly growing market estimated to reach $729B in global market value by 2025. Researchers and companies struggle with access to AI-based drug discovery technology, due to overall cost and lack of expertise - something which requires computational scientists, drug discovery experts, software and systems engineers for AI and ML. To date, Atomwise has provided AI technology to over 750 research collaborations addressing over 600 disease targets, and worked with top-pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners, to design new drugs for ""undruggable"" targets with speed and scale.Through these academic collaborations, Atomwise has enriched its AtomNetÂ® technology with experimental data and conducted the largest screening of molecules in human history - today at over 16 billion molecules for virtual screening. From the continued use of AtomNetÂ® among research teams, Atomwise has gained a valuable breadth of experimental data, including the largest diversity of drug target sites, homology models, protein classes, and disease areas of any AI platform. The company's technology is covered by 19 issued patents, and research partnerships have generated 17 pending patent applications and several peer-reviewed publications. Atomwise has 285 active drug discovery partnerships with researchers at top universities around the world, and recently announced 15 research collaborations with global universities to explore broad-spectrum therapies for COVID-19, targeting 15 unique and novel mechanisms of action.""New technologies are enabling better and faster R&D for the life science industry,"" said Raj Ganguly, co-Founder and Managing Partner at B Capital Group. ""The advancements Atomwise has made with its computational drug discovery platform have effectively cut months or even years off of the R&D lifecycle. More importantly, however, they are solving biology problems previously believed to be unsolvable by researchers and delivering that capability to everyone from academics to big pharma. We're excited to continue to partner with the Atomwise team on its mission to develop new, more effective therapies.""A spokesperson for Sanabil Investments added, ""We chose to lead this B round as Atomwise has shown clear leadership in developing better medicines for the world, and has become the number one global leader in applying and scaling its AI platform for drug discovery programs.

New investors Trustbridge, Comcast Ventures, and Wittington Ventures participated in the round along with existing investors Union Square Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Digital Growth Fund. The company, which has raised $113 million, will use the capital to support rapid patient growth and introduce new sensitive health services, including treatment for headaches and migraines this month.Today Nurx provides care to more than 300,000 patients on a monthly basis, offering an ""all in one"" service by connecting patients, medical providers, and pharmacies in a single platform, eliminating many of the traditional access barriers to healthcare while enabling an efficient and affordable way to deliver patient-centred care. The company is focused on providing high quality care for ""sensitive health"" needs, such as contraception, HIV prevention with PrEP, STI testing and treatment, and herpes treatment, which can be difficult to access and often carry shame and stigma. Nurx is also one of the few digital practices that accepts health insurance while also offering affordable pricing for patients without insurance.Building on the company's growth over the last year, Nurx expects to reach profitability by early 2021 and has provided over 1 million virtual consultations. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has driven increased demand for the company's services with a 75 percent increase in new patient requests for birth control during the first half of the year, totaling over 250,000 new patient requests. Nurx has also received twice as many requests for STI home testing and treatment, PrEP for HIV prevention, and oral and genital herpes treatment services in recent months.""Nurx has demonstrated consistent growth over the last year and as the pandemic placed strain on our healthcare system, the company was well positioned to capture the sudden surge in demand for telemedicine services,"" said Sam Landman, Comcast Ventures Managing Director.

We're eager to see the team continue their accelerated growth, bolstered by shifting consumer expectations and offerings in new categories.""Nurx will leverage the funding to continue investing in sensitive health services, starting with personalized treatment for headaches and migraines in the coming weeks. Considering that women are three times more likely than men to experience migraines, largely due to hormonal fluctuations1, Nurx is well positioned to expand access to treatment within its current patient community of over 300,000 women. Despite being one of the most prevalent health conditions and having a significant impact on everyday well-being, headaches and migraines are often misunderstood and misdiagnosed.

An oral version of imatinib showed significant efficacy in a phase 3 trial as a disease-modifying therapy for PAH, but it was poorly tolerated by PAH patients because of systemic side effects.The Series A for Aerovate, which was founded and incubated by RA Capital Management, is led by Sofinnova Investments, a new investor in the company. Atlas Venture, Cormorant Asset Management, Surveyor Capital (a Citadel company) and Osage University Partners are the other new investors in the round.""Aerovate is a biotechnology company focused on developing drugs that meaningfully improve the lives of patients with rare cardiopulmonary disease. It is exciting to secure financing from such a strong syndicate to progress AV-101, our lead program,"" said Aerovate founding President Benjamin Dake, PhD. He noted that the financing will take AV-101 through a clinical efficacy read-out, with a registrational trial scheduled to begin during the first half of 2021 with PAH patients. ""Sufferers of PAH desperately need a disease-modifying therapy,"" Dake added.AV-101 is an easy-to-use, proprietary dry powder formulation of imatinib that delivers the medicine directly to the lungs. This approach should decrease the systemic adverse effects that hampered the oral version in PAH trials -- by reducing systemic exposure to the drug while simultaneously increasing the dose of medicine delivered directly to diseased lung tissues. AV-101 is administered with a simple inhaler, providing a convenient solution for patients compared to more cumbersome nebulized drugs currently approved in PAH. Those often require prolonged dosing protocols lasting many minutes, multiple times a day, including complicated device assembly and filling - likely reducing patient adherence and impacting real-world efficacy.Aerovate emerged out of RA Capital's seed and incubation program. The concept and proprietary drug product underlying AV-101 were co-invented by the RA Capital venture group and supported by its incubator, Carnot Pharma.""With the support of the high caliber syndicate around the table, I believe Aerovate is poised to move this important treatment into the clinic immediately. This financing keeps the company on a rapid path towards offering this potentially transformational therapeutic to patients with real need,"" said RA Capital Managing Director and Aerovate Board Chair Joshua Resnick, MD.  ""AV-101 strives to provide PAH patients with the benefits of a disease modifying drug - in an easy-to-use format, free from the inconvenience of nebulized products - Â-without the cancer-drug-like side effects of the oral version. This is extremely encouraging news for sufferers of this disease,"" said Resnick.""We are excited about AV-101's potential because the core molecule, imatinib, has shown real efficacy for this use, including cases of hemodynamic remission in severely ill PAH patients. Aerovate's team and their deep experience with PAH and aerosol development suggest that AV-101 may progress quickly and successfully through trials,"" said Sofinnova General Partner and Aerovate Board Director Maha Katabi, PhD.""Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a chronic disorder with a poor quality of life and five-year survival rate of only 57%. In multiple trials, imatinib showed strong clinical benefit for PAH patients that lasted for many months; they experienced improved exercise capacity, lower pulmonary vascular resistance, decreased pulmonary artery pressure and increased cardiac output. Imatinib addresses the underlying cause of the disease, unlike currently available vasodilator therapies,"" said Aerovate Chief Medical Officer Hunter Gillies, MD. ""Building on imatinib's established efficacy, our research gives us strong confidence that AV-101, through targeted delivery to the lungs, will minimize systemic adverse effects, provide good tolerability and potentially be even better at treating the underlying disease than the oral version.""""Given the significant unmet need in PAH, I am excited about leveraging my experience in developing novel products for underserved pulmonary diseases. Having successfully led the Esbriet team through approval for the treatment of IPF in the US, I look forward to working with Aerovate's talented team to develop AV-101 to augment the current standard of care in PAH,"" said Aerovate independent Board Director Jonathan Leff, MD.The Aerovate board will include Atlas Venture Partner David Grayzel, MD, along with Dake, Katabi, Leff and Resnick.About PAHPAH is a disorder that progresses rapidly and afflicts approximately 80,000 people worldwide and for which there are, to date, no approved disease-modifying therapies. PAH is a proliferative disorder of the pulmonary vasculature characterized by remodeling, constriction and occlusion of the small pulmonary arteries resulting in elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation. PAH causes significant strain on the heart, leading to limited physical activity, heart failure and reduced life expectancy. Even with the current standard of care vasodilator therapies, which dilate pulmonary vessels but do not directly modify the disease, PAH often progresses at a fast pace. Aerovate estimates that, based on $5 billion annual sales from the currently approved vasodilator drugs, the market for disease-modifying PAH therapies is significant.About Aerovate TherapeuticsAerovate Therapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on developing drugs that meaningfully improve the lives of patients with rare cardiopulmonary disease.

2020-08-06 00:00:00,Crossbeam Pulls In $25M Series B Financing,https://vcnewsdaily.com/crossbeam/venture-capital-funding/tqnwwyltpy,"PHILADELPHIA, PA, Crossbeam has raised $25 million in a new Series B round, less than two years after it was founded.",Philadelphia,PA,https://vcnewsdaily.com/Crossbeam/venture-funding.php,"According to Crossbeam, which makes a Software-as-a-Service platform that allows companies to securely share data to build or improve inter-company partnerships, has now raised $40.8 million to date. The new round was led by Silicon Valley-based Redpoint Ventures and joined in by Crossbeam's existing array of high-profile investors, Firstmark Capital, both Salesforce's and Slack's venture funds and Uncork Capital. Identity and access management tech firm Okta's venture arm participated in the round as well.The company wasn't originally planning to raise a Series B so soon, CEO Bob Moore said, but Redpoint reached out in mid-June and said it had watched Crossbeam's growth in the market, and wanted to lead its next round.  ""Everything happened really fast,"" he said. ""By the end of June, we figured out it was something we wanted to do. It took a month or so to piece together, and we just closed last weekend.""Along with the funding -which will allow Crossbeam to roughly double its current staff of 28 in the next six months - the company is also making the basic paid tier of its platform, previously $500, free. Both moves are designed to pour lighter fluid on the fire that's already driving Crossbeam's rapid growth, the network effect. Crossbeam works by putting a company's data it normally wouldn't share with prospective partners into a kind of escrow that protects the data. Its customers are then able to use Crossbeam's software to learn more about what customers or prospective customers it has in common with a partner, allowing them to better coordinate sales strategies and workflows. As more companies sign on to Crossbeam, Moore said they encourage their other partners not on the platform to join so they can gain insights into those relationships as well. When Crossbeam raised its $12.5 million Series A last August, it had 145 companies on board. It now has 947. ""What you see there is this incredibly compounding growth coming as a result of this network effect,"" he said. One of the most encouraging signs for Moore is how much Crossbeam's customer base has expanded beyond the VC-backed tech companies that were its ""bread and butter"" leading up to its Series A. ""It's not just hip startups using it,"" he said. ""There's publicly traded companies using it, companies in different industries using it, companies of all different sizes using it."" Making the basic tier free will make it easier for those larger companies to convince smaller partners to join the platform, he said. The goal is to increase the value of it to paying clients and fuel more network growth. Data-fueled software products like Crossbeam are commonplace in other business areas, as SaaS tools have changed the way human resource professionals, salespeople and customer service representatives work. (Think of companies like ADP, Salesforce and Zendesk.) Employees who manage inter-company partnerships haven't seen the same level of innovation, since companies' unwillingness to share customer data directly with other outsiders has always been a roadblock. As a result, most partnership work is done through sending spreadsheets back and forth and one-on-one interactions that are hard to scale, Moore said. In looking to overcome the roadblocks, Crossbeam is potentially in the position to become the main operating system for inter-company collaboration, he said.Moore thinks one of the reasons Crossbeam has caught on so quickly is because it solves such a specific problem, one that he faced repeatedly when co-founding and leading his past two startups, RJ Metrics and its spinout Stitch, to exit. ""I have wanted this product for the past five years,"" he said. ""If this product would have existed, it would have made my life better."" It also helps that this is Moore's third time in the co-founder seat, he said, since he now has 10 years of operational experience and is more willing to be more honest about what he doesn't know, recognize his weaknesses and hire against them. ""We had to do less of running into walls and picking yourself back up,"" he said. ""We've instead been able to really run the playbook of what it looks like to be a venture-backed, scaled company in its early stage.'",Crossbeam,"Crossbeam is a collaborative intelligence platform that helps companies build more valuable partnerships. It serves as an escrow service for data, allowing companies to find overlapping customers and prospects, while keeping the rest of their data private and secure. Not only can Crossbeam help you prioritize the right partners to work with, it can also help you measure the impact those partnership programs have on your business.",Series B,25000000.0

The funding comes from lead investor One Way Ventures, Techstars Ventures, Nimble Ventures, Castor Ventures (AVG), and individual angels such as John Capodilupo (CTO of Whoop). ""We realized that with technology, we could eliminate the natural frictions and inefficiencies that occur in laboratory testing of individuals outside of the hospital setting,"" said BRIO CEO Boris Lipchin. ""We could connect labs and patients that would never otherwise be able to interact and enable access to testing that is not only purpose built to provide a world-class experience to both employers and employees, but does not burden the healthcare system in their community at all.""BRIO's platform puts COVID-19 testing in the employer's hands, enabling them to respond quickly to understand infections among employees, contain potential outbreaks, measure previous exposure, safely maintain business operations, and return people to work-every day, in communities hardest hit by the pandemic. As many essential industries and employees are being asked to work harder than ever, BRIO is focused on bringing peace of mind, as a true partner in the testing process. Many of its clients have used the platform to quickly identify and contain on-site outbreaks, thereby maintaining business operations without having to sacrifice employee health and safety. Companies who have tested with BRIO to date have collectively more than 100,000 employees.""BRIO quickly adapted at the start of the pandemic to combine their laboratory relationships and passion for improving care to create an offering that uniquely addresses the challenges employers are facing due to COVID-19 outbreaks,"" said Semyon Dukach, managing partner of One Way Ventures. ""We are impressed with how they've continually stayed ahead of the testing curve, despite the challenges the system faces at large.""BRIO's unique relationship with a network of labs across the country allows it to offer customers a three-day or less turnaround for delivering COVID-19 test results, even as delivery times have lagged throughout the country amid new coronavirus case spikes. Its network of lab partners have historically been confined to customers in close geographic proximity, but BRIO's platform effectively matches corporate customer needs with labs who can best meet capacity and demand. BRIO's platform allows employers to measure both active COVID-19 infections through FDA Emergency Use Authorized-PCR testing, as well as previous exposure to the virus through industry-leading serological testing, which measures both IgM and IgG antibodies in quantitative formats.BRIO engages medical supervision to requisition tests, so no separate doctor's order is needed, and communicates results from the lab directly to the individual tested, through a secure, HIPAA-compliant online dashboard. Employers gain access to team level data and individual data, with consent. In a world where COVID-19 testing has increasingly suffered from decreasing levels of security, medical oversight and regulatory scrutiny, BRIO maintains the highest standards of regulatory compliance and patient experience.BRIO's customers span manufacturing, food processing and other essential industries that have experienced an outsized impact of COVID-19, and include Harley-Davidson and Lifeway Foods, among others. In some cases, BRIO is able to deploy COVID-19 collection kits and have on-site nurses performing collections in as little as 14 hours from first contact with a customer.ACME Finishing, a Chicago-based business that offers metal finishing and painting as a final stop for manufacturers of leading household products, worked with BRIO to test 25 employees after learning about a few initial infections among its manufacturing workforce.""We thought we had planned for everything and had taken all the precautionary steps. With the potential for an outbreak, our team was asking whether we could morally and ethically justify staying open. But, if we didn't there was a decent chance it could have been the end of our business,"" said G.R. Kearney, president of ACME Finishing.The company kept its operations going once the BRIO testing made it clear the outbreak was limited to a few key individuals, who were already quarantined and isolated, and that the company was not putting the health and safety of its workers at further risk.The labs BRIO works with are CLIA-accredited, a classification that was authorized early on in the pandemic to process COVID-19 test samples.

The funding will support progression to first-in-human clinical trials of the company's Epigenomic Controllers for programs in oncology, inflammation, autoimmune, metabolic, and rare genetic diseases.""We founded Omega with the long-term vision to create a controllable epigenomic programming platform that would identify novel epigenetic targets and therapeutically address them through a new class of genomic medicines,"" said Noubar Afeyan, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Flagship Pioneering and Co-founder and Chairman of the Board for Omega Therapeutics. ""Although human cells all share a common genetic code within their 23 pairs of chromosomes, epigenetic regulation determines identity and function at the tissue and cellular level. Coordinated changes in epigenomic programming drive the cellular variation that controls human biology, in both healthy and diseased states. Omega's platform enables controllable and tunable epigenomic programming. It will provide patients and physicians with therapeutic alternatives to gene editing and gene therapy while offering the advantages of programmable, nucleic acid sequence-based targeting of medicines, while also avoiding the challenges of small molecule-based epigenetic approaches.""""We are advancing the frontiers of medicine through epigenomic programming,"" said Mahesh Karande, President and Chief Executive Officer of Omega Therapeutics. ""We have engineered novel therapeutics that enable controllable epigenomic programming leading to single and multiple gene modulation. We have therapeutic programs in immunology, oncology, metabolism and other disease areas where our precision genomic modulation approach allows us to go after historically 'undruggable' targets,"" Mr. Karande continued. ""Our approach utilizes well-proven aspects of mRNA-based therapeutics as well as drug delivery. We are privileged to continue the Flagship tradition of pioneering innovative genomic medicine-based therapeutic platforms with the potential to generate multiple products, the first of which we plan to have ready for the clinic in 2021.""Omega's epigenomic programming platform is focused on selectively directing the human genome to treat and cure disease by precisely controlling genomic expression without altering native nucleic acid sequences. Omega has created a proprietary platform and knowledge base that identifies Insulated Genomic Domains (IGDs) and their biological functions in both healthy and diseased states across cell types. IGDs naturally function as the fundamental regulators of the human genome and can be modulated to up- or down-regulate single or multiple genes simultaneously. These scientific and product insights drive the discovery and development of disease-specific genomic modulators called Epigenomic Controllers, which are engineered to precisely tune genomic activity to desired therapeutic levels with high targeting specificity and durability of effect.""Our Epigenomic Controllers comprise a DNA-binding domain and an epigenetic effector domain delivered as mRNA to modulate gene expression. Besides treating monogenic diseases, our therapeutics can, for example, target and modulate difficult-to-drug oncogenes and growth factors, treat complex multi-genic diseases, and control cellular programming and differentiation,"" said Thomas McCauley, Ph.D., the company's Chief Scientific Officer.
