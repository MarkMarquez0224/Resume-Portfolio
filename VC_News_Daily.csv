The company has experienced tremendous growth following a worldwide movement to remote work. Revenues have grown over 90% already, and the company is on pace to triple its customer base in 2020. This continued momentum speaks to a significant market need for engineering leaders to have better visibility, drive strategic alignment, and improve performance as more organizations move to remote and distributed workplaces. Jellyfish is the brainchild of Andrew Lau, David Gourley, and Phil Braden, former engineering and product leaders who faced the challenges of managing growing teams and aligning their work with the strategic direction of the business at companies like Endeca and Groupon. ""As engineering organizations scale,"" said Andrew Lau, the team's CEO, ""it becomes increasingly difficult for leaders to keep a pulse on what their teams are working on, whether those things are aligned with the company's strategy, and how these teams are performing."" That is especially true of remote and distributed teams, where visibility into the daily work productivity and alignment poses an even greater challenge. ""Leaders need a comprehensive picture of their organizations now more than ever. But in a world where software development has become the foundation of modern business, data-driven engineering insights are still scarce.""""Sales and Marketing have data-driven tools like Salesforce and Marketo,"" explains Patrick Rubeski, VP of Engineering at Buildium, a Real Page Company. ""I needed something similar to run the operations of my engineering organization that's distributed across three locations in addition to a remote workforce. We found that only Jellyfish provided the right balance of capabilities, connecting our day-to-day operations up to strategic level metrics with their Allocation Framework.""By aggregating data from engineering tools, or ""engineering signals,"" along with contextual business data and applying intelligence, the Jellyfish Engineering Management Platform (EMP) provides the kind of visibility engineering leaders need to make sure the team is working on the things that are strategically aligned to the business, optimize the team's execution, and deliver results faster. ""Businesses depend on data now more than ever, but they're just scratching the surface,"" said Accel's Ping Li. ""In modern organizations with distributed engineering teams and remote workforces, the need for data-driven visibility and alignment is stronger than ever. Jellyfish takes a unique approach to data-driven engineering to provide that alignment where others cannot.""About JellyfishJellyfish is the leading Engineering Management Platform (EMP), providing complete visibility into engineering organizations, the work they do, and how they operate.

The round was led by Energy Impact Partners.",Columbus,OH,https://vcnewsdaily.com/Finite%20State/venture-funding.php,"Finite State, experts in supply chain security and risk management for IoT and embedded devices, announced today that it has raised $12.5 Million in a Series A funding round. The round was led by Energy Impact Partners, who were joined by Zetta Venture Partners, cybersecurity veteran Niloofar Howe, and other undisclosed investors. This round follows a $7M seed round led by Drive Capital, a Midwest based fund with $1.2B under management, bringing the total company funding to $19.5M.Based in Columbus and founded in 2017 by Matt Wyckhouse, founder and former CTO of Battelle's Cyber Business Unit, Finite State has remained largely in stealth mode as its team has worked diligently on building advanced technology that uncovers vulnerabilities and threats in the supply chain of IoT and connected devices. Despite keeping a low profile, the company widely showcased its unique capabilities in June of 2019 when its Huawei Supply Chain Assessment revealed numerous backdoors and major security vulnerabilities in the Chinese technology company's networking devices that could be used in 5G networks. The report has been cited by government officials, cybersecurity experts, and in news and media around the world. This round of funding will allow Finite State to scale its team of world-class engineers, whose mission is focused on advancing the company's cutting-edge technology that enables unprecedented visibility into device firmware. With its focus on users and manufacturers of connected devices in the energy, telecommunications, and national security sectors, an expanded team will give Finite State the bandwidth to secure some of the world's most critical infrastructure.""The exponential growth of connected devices powering our critical infrastructure is driving attackers to change their tactics and target these more vulnerable devices,"" said Matt Wyckhouse, Founder and CEO of Finite State. ""Finite State focuses on creating transparency within supply chains, so manufacturers and end users can work together to mitigate vulnerabilities before they are exploited.""""The proliferation of internet of things (IoT) devices has enabled a smarter and more resilient electric grid. As operators rapidly deploy IoT devices for critical industrial and business functions, the stakes have never been higher for security teams to keep up with the risks and vulnerabilities that exist within these devices,"" said Sameer Reddy, partner at EIP. ""We're excited to partner with Finite State as the company brings its platform to the energy sector to provide operators with exceptional, real-time intelligence of supply chain risk.""""Finite State takes a uniquely data-driven approach to discovering vulnerabilities in the IoT fabric that now powers every part of the economy from transportation to health care to fundamental infrastructure,"" said Jocelyn Goldfein of Zetta Venture Partners. Zetta was also among the company's initial investors. She goes on to say that ""IoT represents the new frontier of cyber attacks, and Finite State's unique threat intelligence is an invaluable assist for defenders."" PRIORITIZING SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITYThe complexity of supply chains for connected devices makes it extremely difficult to know whether or not a device is truly secure. Because device manufacturers source parts and software from many different vendors, it is challenging for them to understand and mitigate the risks their devices pose without extensive testing. Through firmware analysis on behalf of device manufacturers and their customers, Finite State's platform is able to automatically scan each device and provide an in-depth analysis into the device's firmware, including the presence of known vulnerabilities, potential backdoors, supply chain threats, and other crucial information that affects the overall risk of each device. This information is key to allowing end users to understand and mitigate the risk presented by each device, and it allows OEMs to address and resolve these issues and share the risk analysis with their customers. This transparency is the key to creating more secure supply chains and ensuring safer networks in all industries from utilities to manufacturing, healthcare to government systems.ABOUT FINITE STATEThe mission of Finite State is to protect the devices that power our modern lives by illuminating the vulnerabilities and threats within their complex software supply chains.

With this, Illumina's Nick Naclerio, founding partner, and HLM's Steven Tolle, partner, will be joining LetsGetChecked's board as members.WHAT IT DOESFounded in 2014, LetsGetChecked provides consumer customers with a range of at-home testing kits, such as ones for hormone levels, sexually transmitted infections, liver performance, nutrition and - specifically for frontline healthcare workers - COVID-19.Customers receive their kit in the mail, with which they collect and return a personal sample for testing. One of the startup's lab partners analyzes the sample and returns it to a LetsGetChecked physician, who reviews the results and counsels customers - over the phone, if necessary. For later reference, test results are saved in a LetsGetChecked patient app that interfaces with Apple Health, Fitbit, Garmin and other consumer-friendly health tools.As of March, the company has also been offering a COVID-19 ""twin-track"" antibody and PCR test exclusive to providers working at the point of care. However, the company said it hopes to release a direct-to-consumer version of the testing kit down the road.""The company's work has never been more important now that the world faces a global pandemic, forcing us all to re-evaluate how we obtain health and wellness services,"" Illumina's Naclerio said in a statement. ""LetsGetChecked is already having a profound impact on patient-led at-home healthcare, which is necessary now and will become increasingly common in the future.""WHAT IT'S FORThe company said these funds will help build up its manufacturing, supply and testing capacity for COVID-19.

""With the onset of COVID-19, we realigned resources with a view to helping with this global pandemic and are currently delivering tens of thousands of tests per day to critical and frontline healthcare workers""MARKET SNAPSHOTConsumer-facing home testing startups were already picking up momentum around the time of LetsGetChecked's $30 million Series B, with competitors like EverlyWell, healthy.io and Scanwell Health all announcing new rounds or services over the course of the last year. However, COVID-19 has ramped up demand across the industry and led to some confusion with the FDA on more than one occasion. But the window for these companies to take their COVID-19 tests directly to consumers appears to be reopening: It was just a few weeks ago that LabCorp's COVID-19 RT-PCR test became the first permitted for at-home sample collection.ON THE RECORD""HLM invests in companies that inherently drive adoption due to the need they serve, and companies that leverage important market trends,"" Tolle said in a statement. ""In this case, LetsGetChecked is helping to improve consumer access to care, which is increasingly essential."""

As part of the deal, Lime will acquire Uber's Jump bike-sharing business operations and the two companies will expand the integration of their mobile apps.The investment round valued Lime at $400 million, a person familiar with the terms said, asking not to be identified because they're private. That's a massive drop from the $2.4 billion investors priced the company at in a funding round last year. Lime didn't comment on the valuation in the statement.Venture capitalists have invested more than $1 billion in the last few years in two startups renting electric scooters -- Lime and Bird -- but they began falling out of favor this year. First unprofitable business models fell out of fashion, and then the pandemic kept customers stuck at home. Both companies had to drastically reduce their fleets by mid-March.Lime said in January it was cutting 14% of staff, about 100 employees, and retreating from a dozen markets in a drive toward profitability. In March it said it was ""winding down or pausing"" service in all markets but South Korea. And in April, further job cuts were announced.Lime said its chief executive officer, Brad Bao, would be replaced by Wayne Ting, previously the company's head of operations. Bao will continue as board chairman.Global self-isolation measures and government bans on travel had decimated Lime's ability to generate revenue from the hundreds of thousands of scooters it has around the world. The company went from 147,000 scooter trips globally on March 14 to about 52,000 three days later as Europe went into lockdown.Scooter companies are also suffering from a sharp decline in transportation spending and a newfound aversion to the sharing economy. This combination of factors is also weighing heavily on Airbnb Inc., Getaround Inc., Lyft Inc. and Uber. Lyft said Wednesday that it's cutting 17% of its workforce."

Not only does Emtrain's solution meet increasing state and federal compliance training regulations, but it also diagnoses issues that are otherwise invisible to business leaders and benchmarks those issues against a global average so that internal stakeholders know where to focus their time and attention for maximum and measurable results. The diagnostic tool and data provide a win/win for employers and employees who both want to prevent these issues but lack the visibility, tools and organizational structure to do so effectively.Emtrain's recently launched Emtrain.ai solution has already collected over seven million employee sentiment responses about core culture indicators that exist in organizations such as power dynamics; in-group/out-group dynamics; unconscious biases and other indicators that correlate with a higher risk for bad culture outcomes. The company's initial report, Emtrain's 2020 Workplace Culture Report, published in March, shows that only 17% of employees will report sexual harassment to HR if they see or experience it.  Other data is consistent in that it shows employees don't typically report problems. The result is these problems remain invisible to HR and compliance leaders until there's an explosive incident that rocks the culture. ""Our changing demographics, social norms and current tough business climate require a better solution to educate employees of their rights and responsibilities and how to be a culture leader while informing employers where they need to focus their time and attention to support a healthy culture,"" said Janine Yancey, Founder and CEO of Emtrain. ""U.S. businesses spend five billion dollars each year on compliance training without getting real business value; no business intelligence, no benchmarking, no evidence of behavior modification, nothing but a completion certificate. Business leaders are increasingly demanding business value from these programs and a way to solve behavioral problems before they turn into bad outcomes. Emtrain uses data, analytics, and benchmarking to show companies where they are vulnerable and how to address their hotspots in a proactive way.""""Janine has a bold, unique vision on how to change the way organizations identify their risk and prevent complex culture issues from becoming damaging,"" said EGP Managing Partner Peter Campbell. ""Janine Yancey and her team have developed their predictive frameworks and data sets over 15 years, and have now built a breakthrough product that anticipates where the market has moved.

Covariant will use the funding to accelerate its partnerships, introduce AI Robotics to new industries, and grow its research, engineering and commercial teams.From food distribution to healthcare to e-commerce, the global supply chain is facing unprecedented pressure to deliver orders quickly, reliably and efficiently, while keeping workers safe. Automation is the key to meeting those challenges.While repetitive and predictable tasks like the movement of goods have successfully been automated, complex and unpredictable tasks that require hands, such as picking, placing and unloading, have not. Traditional automation can't handle the constant change and infinite variability of these tasks. Automating them requires advanced AI that can understand, learn and adapt.Founded in 2017, Covariant is building the Covariant Brain, universal AI that enables robots to see, reason and act autonomously in the real world. Covariant robots learn general abilities such as robust 3D perception, physical affordances of objects, few-shot learning and real-time motion planning which gives them the intelligence to learn how to manipulate new objects they've never seen before in environments where they've never operated.In January 2020, Covariant launched from stealth to reveal that it had reached a new AI milestone: its AI Robotics stations were running consistently at customer facilities in North America and Europe in the apparel, pharmaceutical and electronics industries, and had achieved autonomy in live production, with a mean unassisted operating time greater than one hour.""When we founded Covariant, our goal was to make AI Robotics work autonomously in the real world,"" said Pieter Abbeel, Covariant's President, Chief Scientist and co-founder. ""Having reached that milestone, we see a huge benefit in expanding our universal AI to new use cases, customer environments and industries.""The funding comes on the heels of significant momentum for the company. Soon after launching from stealth, Covariant invested in strategic partnerships to accelerate the deployment of robotic stations to customers. In February, Covariant announced a partnership with ABB, a leading industrial robotics supplier. In March, Covariant joined forces with Knapp, a leading supplier of intralogistics systems.""As the coronavirus crisis has exposed serious frailty in the global supply chain, we're seeing more demand than ever for our AI Robotics solutions,"" said Peter Chen, Covariant CEO and co-founder.

Next Coast Ventures led the round with participation from Meridian Street Capital.Additional investors in the round include former athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush, Everlywell CEO Julia Cheek, Bright Health CTO Brian Gambs and Capital Factory. The funding will be used to recruit a top team of engineers and designers to scale the HSA offering and build new functionality for First Dollar's platform.Today, the nation's more than 26 million Health Savings Accounts control $61.7 billion in assets, but the healthcare industry is the primary beneficiary of that total. Most users allow their contributions to sit idle, turning a potential investment vehicle into an under-utilized bank account. Only 11% of participants maximize their contributions each year, and only 13% invest their HSA savings for growth. Even worse, many HSAs charge a monthly fee, so savings are slowly depleted by as much as $100 per year.Empowering Consumers with a Modern Health Care Savings Account PlatformTo solve these problems, First Dollar co-founders Jason Bornhorst and Colin Anawaty set about building an HSA people will actually use. There are no monthly fees, and there will be a heavy focus on easy-to-understand language, education on how to maximize savings and an offering of high-quality health care products at fair prices. No other company offers this complete ecosystem.""HSAs are the worst-marketed health care benefit in the United States,"" said Bornhorst, First Dollar CEO. ""Most of them are effectively little-used bank accounts. We're building a product that not only helps you maximize your savings but also offers great health care at a great price. We believe that for every $1 you put into your First Dollar HSA, you should get $2 in value back in savings and spending.""""I've been an HSA user for years, and it's an amazing tool if you know how to use it,"" said Anawaty, First Dollar's chief product officer. ""The products on the market, though, don't live up to the power of the HSA. I'm excited to build a product that people will love that makes their finances healthier and also helps them make more informed decisions about their long-term health.""First Dollar targets Millennials and Gen Z, a generally healthy population that typically spends too much per year for more coverage than they need. Only 1 in 5 people in those demographics reach their deductible amount each year. First Dollar believes they would be better served by putting the money they spend on premiums into a simple, informative, 100% fee-free HSA account.Investor Perspectives on First Dollar Seed Funding Round""Two of the biggest concerns on people's minds today are their money and their health,"" said Mike Smerklo, Next Coast Ventures co-founder and managing partner. ""In an ever-changing healthcare market, it pays to have leaders who know the space.

NEA, Ribbit Capital, 9Yards Capital, and Unusual Ventures also participated in the round. Robinhood's most recent round comes after a $323 million Series E in July 2019 at a $7.6 billion valuation. In a blog post about the news, Robinhood announced it had added three million funded accounts since the start of the year. ""Robinhood has made the financial markets accessible to the masses, and in turn, revolutionized the decades-old brokerage industry,"" said Andrew Reed, partner at Sequoia, in a statement. ""We're excited to further our relationship with Robinhood, which we believe is at the beginning of its opportunity.""The growth came despite significant outages that plagued the fintech in early March. The app was down for consecutive days during the first week of March as the markets were rocked with volatility. In a note posted on its blog, Robinhood's cofounders, cited ""stress to its infrastructure"" from an ""unprecedented load.""In an interview with Fortune regarding the raise, Vlad Tenev, co-CEO and cofounder, described the outages as a ""curveball."" As for the new funding, Tenev earmarked it for further growth. ""The purpose of the capital raise is to enable us to have flexibility and be strategic, and continue to invest in the platform,"" Tenev told Fortune. ""We envision that over the next few years, Robinhood will expand globally and continue rolling out more products.""The latest round is yet another example of Robinhood to continue to raise capital despite slipups. In December 2018 the startup quickly backtracked from an announcement it made for a planned cash-management product after saying it would be SIPC insured despite not checking with the organization ahead of time. That same month Robinhood's options trading experienced an outage. The startup offered some of those affected $75 Amazon gift cards.In November 2019, some Robinhood users uncovered an ""infinite leverage"" glitch.The following month the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fined the brokerage $1.25 million for not following ""best execution"" practices from October 2016 to November 2017."

Worldwide stay-at-home orders have dramatically increased demand for many businesses, putting increasing stress on the modern tech stack. Economic uncertainty is encouraging greater efficiency, setting the stage for further migration away from legacy, closed-source data platforms to modern, distributed, cloud-native tools. This round of funding will facilitate Cockroach Labs' growing investments in R&D to better support customers as they change to meet these new requirements. Enterprises in areas including communications, gaming and entertainment, e-commerce and financial services are scrambling to support increased consumer demand and remote workforces, and are finding that the resiliency and flexibility necessary to do so just isn't available without an elastically scalable, multi-cloud, modern data platform like CockroachDB.Since its inception in 2016, the CockroachDB next-generation SQL database has helped organizations move and manage critical transactional data in the cloud. The software has developed an ardent and loyal following among architects, developers, and academics by capitalizing on the failed cloud migration promises of legacy database players and the risks associated with ""lock-in"" from the large public cloud vendors. This has resulted in year-over-year commercial customer growth of 295 percent. And once these users found what they were looking for in CockroachDB, they have doubled-down-first-year customers have, on average, expanded their usage 2x, and have renewed at a rate of over 90 percent.Today, Fortune 500 CIOs are taking notice: while CockroachDB has only been available for two years, it is already in use at some of the world's largest enterprises across all industries, including Equifax, Bose and Comcast. More businesses are turning to CockroachDB to help in both expanding to meet new demand, reducing costs, and moving to the cloud. A recent survey of open roles, specifically for CockroachDB developers, on LinkedIn shows over 40 positions at 25 of the top enterprise companies across industries. Companies include Apple, Honey, Facebook, Tesla and Via.""The migration to a multi-cloud environment has long been underway at many, if not all, of the top global enterprises. What cannot be taken for granted in the rush to the cloud is resiliency and scalability, which is near impossible to do without a distributed database that is elastic and self-healing,"" said CEO and co-founder of Cockroach Labs, Spencer Kimball. ""It's a given that this is the way of the future. But as that future approaches faster than many expected it is putting immense pressure on the enterprise to make this leap now, as quickly and effortlessly as possible. CockroachDB was purpose-built for mission-critical, data-intensive, cloud-deployed applications, and as a result, we are seeing a tremendous increase in demand for our services from companies small and large looking for bulletproof resiliency, effortless scalability and an overall more cost-effective platform.""A Massive Market, Ripe for Disruption""The cloud has provided the opportunity to rethink all aspects of IT infrastructure and software,"" explained Tony Baer, principal at dbinsight. ""CockroachDB is a prime example of how the cloud is reinventing databases, removing traditional shackles to scale and volume that have constrained them, clearing the way for new forms of globally-distributed applications that weren't thinkable before.""The worldwide public cloud services market is forecasted to grow nearly 20 percent in 2020 to a total upwards of $260 billion, according to an analyst firm. It also expects that by 2022, 75 percent of all databases (which saw 18.4 percent of growth in revenue in 2018) will be deployed or migrated to a cloud platform. With double-digit growth in the database market, this represents a larger move away from legacy players like Oracle as companies look for more nimble cloud-native databases. Amidst such growth, the greatest innovation is coming from companies that arose out of the open-source software movement, many of which are poised to disrupt slower-moving players operating on either decades-old technology or on an assembly of services cobbled together via acquisition. As the world's first cloud-native, distributed SQL database, Cockroach Labs is the only player in the space built from the ground up with the needs of the global enterprise in mind.""Legacy players have long dominated the enterprise software market. With recent investments in companies like Confluent, Snowflake, and now Cockroach Labs, we're seeing huge market disruption as enterprises move to the cloud and build on a modern tech stack, replacing legacy companies, who are struggling to adapt,"" said Kevin Wang, partner at Altimeter Capital. ""Cockroach Labs is leading this next evolution with a world-class team, ambitious vision, and a transformative product. It's a great time to be in the cloud business.""Cockroach most recently closed a $55 million Series C financing round last summer to invest in hiring new talent-doubling its headcount over the past twelve months-and furthering research and development.About Cockroach LabsCockroach Labs helps organizations migrate and manage critical transactional data in the cloud with their next-generation SQL database.

The financing also attracted new investors Adage Capital Management, HealthQuest Capital, Partner Fund Management, and Rock Springs Capital, as well as existing investors. In addition, $17 million in growth capital was secured through CIBC Innovation Banking to refinance an existing debt facility.Proceeds from this financing will ensure that Pulmonx is well-capitalized to support the continued global commercial expansion of the Zephyr Valve System, the first FDA-approved minimally-invasive treatment option for severe emphysema, a form of COPD. The Zephyr Valve procedure, done through a simple bronchoscopy with no incision or tissue resection, is clinically proven to improve patients' breathing, exercise capacity, and quality of life, without the risks of major surgery.1""Ally Bridge is pleased to support Pulmonx in this oversubscribed financing,"" said Frank Yu, Founder, CEO and CIO of Ally Bridge Group. ""The combination of Pulmonx' Zephyr Valve System, patient assessment tools, established reimbursement programs, and global commercial footprint positions it as the world leader in interventional COPD procedures.""Emphysema is a progressive and life-threatening form of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and represents about 25% of all COPD patients. In the United States, COPD is the third leading cause of death and is expected to be associated with approximately $49 billion in direct medical costs in 2020. Emphysema is a debilitating and life-threatening disease that progressively destroys lung tissue, resulting in a diminishing ability to breathe and engage in the most basic daily activities, leading to further deconditioning and to a high mortality rate. It is estimated that more than 1.2M severe emphysema patients in the US, Europe and Japan are candidates for the Zephyr Valve treatment. Medical therapy delivers limited benefit in later stage patients, and because of the high risks and limited availability, surgical options are only available for a narrow patient population.""We are pleased to be able to accelerate our efforts to bring our landmark technology to severe emphysema patients who need it,"" said Glen French, CEO of Pulmonx. ""The recently secured financing will ensure we are able to continue to scale our commercialization efforts to meet the global demand for our Zephyr Valve System, as well as continue R&D efforts on new minimally-invasive pulmonary treatments.""About Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction with the Zephyr ValveBronchoscopic lung volume reduction with the Zephyr Valve is a one-time procedure performed through a bronchoscope, which requires no cutting or incisions. During the procedure, an average of four valves are placed in the airways to block off a diseased portion of the lung. The target area then reduces in size and allows adjacent healthier lung tissue to expand and function more efficiently. This results in patients being able to breathe more easily and experience less shortness of breath. Many patients treated with the Zephyr Valves have reported immediate relief and the ability to go back to doing everyday tasks with greater ease within weeks of treatment. Data from four published randomized controlled clinical studies have proven that the Zephyr Valve delivers significant and persistent improvement in pulmonary function, exercise capacity, breathlessness, and quality of life with less morbidity and mortality than surgical treatment options.2,3,4,5 These data have led to the inclusion of Zephyr Valves in several national and global treatment guidelines including the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellent (NICE) and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) which gives endobronchial valves a level 'A' evidence rating, the highest rating possible.About Pulmonx CorporationPulmonx is the global leader in interventional procedures for the treatment of COPD. It develops and markets non-surgical technologies for the assessment and treatment of patients with severe emphysema, a progressive and life-threatening form of COPD. The Pulmonx solution, which is comprised of the Zephyr Endobronchial Valve (Zephyr Valve), the Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System (Chartis System) and the StratX Lung Analysis Platform, is designed to treat severe emphysema patients who, despite medical management, are still profoundly symptomatic and either do not want or are ineligible for surgical approaches. The technology is supported by a compelling body of clinical evidence including over 100 published scientific articles regarding the clinical benefits of Zephyr Valves. FDA granted the Zephyr Valve a ""breakthrough device"" designation, and in June 2018 Pulmonx received FDA pre-market approval to commercialize our Zephyr Valve. The Zephyr Valve is now commercially available and physicians in more than 25 countries around the world routinely use the Zephyr Valves to improve the lives of patients with severe emphysema, with over 76,000 valves used to treat more than 19,000 patients worldwide to date.In addition to the Zephyr Valve System, the Company is planning further clinical trials of AeriSealÂ®, a foam-based lung sealant delivered through a bronchoscope to treat the subset of advanced emphysema that cannot be treated with the Zephyr valve.

This represents the second closing in the investment process for the HLB Consortium, ($10M was placed in February 2020), and substantially increases their holding in Immunomic Therapeutics to 47.6% of the common stock. HLB also secured an option to make further investment into the company in the months ahead.""We are pleased to welcome HLB as a significant shareholder of Immunomic Therapeutics and look forward to working with them within the framework of the HLB Bio family of companies. They have a proven track record of success in Asia and share our commitment and passion for developing best-in-class therapies for cancer and other serious diseases,"" said Dr. William Hearl, CEO of Immunomic Therapeutics. ""With HLB's support, we are well-positioned to accelerate our efforts in immuno-oncology, in particular glioblastoma multiforme, and rapidly advance other key candidates in our pipeline, including our most recent initiative into infectious diseases with development of our vaccine candidate for COVID-19.""Proceeds from the financing will support the acceleration of ITI's Phase II clinical trial of ITI-1000 for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), advance its emerging pipeline, and expand upon the current applications of its UNITE platform. The financing will also enable Immunomic to expand its team and infrastructure to support the future growth of the company.In addition, ITI and HLB intend to establish an Asian Brain Cancer Research Center in Seoul that will bring together the world's leading experts and cutting-edge science to advance research in the GBM field and to deploy ITI-1000 to the Asian population. ITI-1000 is a cell therapy powered by ITI's UNITE platform that is currently being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial (ATTAC-II) in collaboration with researchers at the University of Florida (Dr. Duane Mitchell) and Duke University (Dr. John Sampson). ITI-1001 is an alternative, cell-free approach to treating GBM. The company held a successful pre-IND meeting earlier this year for ITI-1001 and expects to be able to file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of 2020.Concurrent with the financing, five (5) members from HLB Co., LTD will be joining the Immunomic Therapeutics Board of Directors.About UNITEITI's investigational UNITE platform, or UNiversal Intracellular Targeted Expression, works by fusing pathogenic antigens with the Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein, an endogenous protein in humans, for immune processing. In this way, ITI's vaccines (DNA or RNA) have the potential to utilize the body's natural biochemistry to develop a broad immune response including antibody production, cytokine release and critical immunological memory. This approach could put UNITE technology at the crossroads of immunotherapies in a number of illnesses, including cancer, allergy and infectious diseases. UNITE is currently being employed in Phase II clinical trials as a cancer immunotherapy. ITI is also collaborating with academic centers and biotechnology companies to study the use of UNITE in cancer types of high mortality, including cases where there are limited treatment options like glioblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia. ITI believes that these early clinical studies may provide a proof of concept for UNITE therapy in cancer, and if successful, set the stage for future studies, including combinations in these tumor types and others. Preclinical data is currently being developed to explore whether LAMP nucleic acid constructs may amplify and activate the immune response in highly immunogenic tumor types and be used to create immune responses to tumor types that otherwise do not provoke an immune response.About Immunomic Therapeutics, Inc.Immunomic Therapeutics, Inc. (ITI) is a privately-held, clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of vaccines through its proprietary technology platform, UNiversal Intracellular Targeted Expression (UNITE), which is designed to utilize the body's natural biochemistry to develop vaccines that generate broad immune responses. UNITE has a robust history of applications in various therapeutic areas, including infectious diseases, oncology, allergy and autoimmune diseases. ITI is primarily focused on applying the UNITE platform to oncology, where it could potentially have broad applications, including viral antigens, cancer antigens, neoantigens and antigen-derived antibodies as biologics. The Company has built a large pipeline from UNITE with six oncology programs and two allergy programs. ITI has entered into a significant allergy partnership with Astellas Pharma and has formed several academic collaborations with leading Immuno-oncology researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute, Johns Hopkins University of Medicine, and Duke University.

With this new funding, Pivot Bio will accelerate its plans to scale its first-to-market microbial nitrogen technology that increases crop yields and farmer revenue. The technology will also aid in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and global energy use related to the $65 billion global synthetic nitrogen fertilizer market. Pivot Bio PROVEN™, the company's inaugural product for corn, consistently delivers more nitrogen into the crop than synthetic nitrogen, translating to an average of 5.8 bushels per acre advantage when compared to fields using only synthetic nitrogen in 2019.By adopting Pivot Bio's cleaner nitrogen, agriculture will simultaneously achieve more consistent yields and eliminate one gigaton of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions (akin to removing 216 million cars off the road). Additionally, water-borne nitrates will be reduced, avoiding an estimated $4.1 billion in U.S. water purification costs and significantly reducing the dead zones in our oceans. These reductions are driven by Pivot Bio helping farmers shrink their use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer by at least 100 million metric tons over the coming decade.""Growers and our planet deserve a better fertilizer - one that balances on-farm economics with the farmer's commitment to leave the land better for the next generation, and Pivot Bio's technology helps them do just that,"" said Karsten Temme, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of Pivot Bio.

""The company is leading the charge on truly sustainable farming techniques, and we're confident that they'll continue to innovate their product offerings to solve this critical climate and societal challenge.""Manufactured, sold, and distributed to farmers in a radically different model from traditional synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, Pivot Bio's approach uses significantly less energy than the manufacturing of synthetic fertilizer, eliminates 99.5% of greenhouse gas emissions during its production, and is delivered through regular shipping carriers. This model eliminates the costly infrastructure of factories, pipelines, barges, and storage at brick-and-mortar retail locations. Instead, local trusted agronomic advisors can leverage a simplified mobile app to order and schedule on-demand delivery as they help farmers plan their nutrient management strategy.""Pivot Bio is addressing one of the most difficult challenges facing agriculture in the 21st century - reducing dependence on damaging synthetic fertilizer while increasing crop yields and creating better outcomes for farmers,"" said Matt Ocko, Managing Partner, DCVC. ""DCVC led Pivot Bio's early rounds and remains a major backer because we believe the company will truly transform global agricultural practices.

All existing investors participated in the round, including Silverton Partners, Floodgate and Village Global. The funding comes on the heels of Ontic's 5X year-over-year growth, increased demand and expanded platform usage from dozens of Fortune 1000 clients.""In recent weeks, our clients across all industries have seen a 300 percent increase in COVID-19 and threat-related data. Now more than ever, in the midst of this pandemic health crisis that has remote and mobile workforces always-on across time zones, businesses can't afford to turn a blind eye to the rising threats to their employees, facilities and assets,"" said Lukas Quanstrom, Chief Executive Officer, Ontic. ""Ontic understands that many physical security teams lack a comprehensive view of emerging threats, and vital pre-incident indicators often live in silos across tools and teams, inhibiting collaboration. It is critically important to aggregate and make sense of the data security teams need to proactively connect the dots before it's too late.""Ontic's platform connects to hundreds of real-time and historical data points and provides curated access to smart indicators that deliver the most relevant intelligence to security teams - faster - for early threat detection. By unifying critical data related to physical security threats and enabling smart collaboration with connected workflows in a single software platform, Ontic gives security teams the ability to better identify pre-incident indicators, assess risk and mitigate potential threats.Expanded Platform Offers Early Indicators for Internal and External ThreatsFrom helping corporate security and executive protection teams keep external threats at bay, to internal assessments for early indication of workplace violence or insider threats, Ontic's platform enables Fortune 1000 security teams to protect their people, properties and reputation. With the recent launch of two new Ontic Platform modules, Incident Management and Assessments, security teams can better identify, investigate and prevent employee behavioral issues before an incident takes place. For example, given the significant growth of the on-demand economy, especially during the COVID-19 crisis, Ontic has seen a large demand in supporting delivery and driver programs by managing the investigative workflow required to keep these employees and their customers safe.""Protective intelligence is the last key segment of security that has been largely untouched by innovation over the last decade. Intelligence is still managed today in a manual way with disparate point solutions at a time when the level of data about threats is exploding across social media, visitor management, and other public and private data sources,"" said Victoria Treyger, General Partner and Managing Director at Felicis Ventures. ""We invested in Ontic because we believe its platform will become the definitive system of record for the intelligence vertical and look forward to working with the Ontic team to help them achieve this vision.""The $12 million investment will be used to fuel the expansion of Ontic's footprint across enterprise businesses and family offices while accelerating product development and expanding sales to enter new markets.About OnticThe Ontic protective intelligence software platform unifies real-time and historical data related to physical security threats and behaviors of concern, and enables smart collaboration with connected workflows, so security teams can get more relevant intelligence - faster - for early threat detection.
