The $85M in debt was secured from multiple institutional lenders.The new funding will allow Homeward to purchase more homes for its customers, and expand its agent partnerships.""Despite COVID-related volatility, we've continued to see strong customer and agent demand for our offering. Housing inventory is low right now, but demand remains high and customers are using our non-contingent cash offers to beat out other bidders,"" said Tim Heyl, founder and CEO at Homeward.Jeffrey Diehl, Adam Street's Managing Partner and Head of Investments, will join the board. Jeff led an early investment in BoomTown, one of the leading CRM solutions for real estate agents, and the investment in Homeward is consistent with Adam Street's focus to target resilient companies that need capital to fuel growth.""We are a selective investor, particularly in the current environment, but Homeward stood out,"" said Jeffrey Diehl.

""We think they have an A+ team and a solid model that's well positioned to scale in a way the industry and the capital markets will embrace.""Putting agents back in the center of real estate transaction innovationTim Heyl founded Homeward to empower modern real estate agents. Tim is one of the country's top agents, has sold over 3,500 homes, and founded the Heyl Group in 2009, which has grown to become one of the top 25 agent teams in the country.""Most technology companies have come from outside the real estate space and have tried to cut the agent out,"" said Heyl. ""We're taking a much different approach. We empower agents with institutional capital so they can enable their clients to buy before they sell.""43% of home buyers have an existing home they need to sell before they buy their next one. This hurdle can cause homeowners to delay their move indefinitely, which hurts both customers and their agents.To solve this problem, Homeward works with agents to get their clients approved to make a Homeward all-cash offer. Agents go directly to Homeward's site and can register their client in less than a minute. Homeward then works to approve their client to make an all-cash offer.The company will be expanding its relationships with top agents in the three states it operates in: Texas, Colorado, and Georgia.

""They were able to move into their new home first, then take their time to sell their old home, ultimately earning them $40,000 more than low-ball iBuyer offers.""Redesigning the home buying experienceThe Homeward Way is the company's core offering. It gives homebuyers credit for their home equity up front, and lets them make an all-cash offer to secure their next home using the company's funds. Homeward customers also receive a floor price guarantee on their existing home in case they're unable to sell it for its full market value. Buyers that use Homeward's all-cash offer get an average discount of 2 - 5% on their next home and are twice as likely to beat buyers who make mortgage-backed offers. Homeward customers  can also stay in their current home while they make improvements to their new property. They only move once and can control the timing of their move.Homeward customers don't have to sell their existing homes at a discount to iBuyers, which typically offer below market pricing and charge fees greater than those of traditional real estate agents. The service charge for Homeward is transparent, between 2 - 3% of the purchase price depending on the home's size and location, compared to iBuyers who charge up to 9% of the home sale price. iBuyers also take a portion of the real estate agent's commission, and in some cases force the home buyer to work exclusively with their agent.The Homeward Way:1 - Get approved: Submit an online application and Homeward will calculate your home equity and provide you with an approval in minutes.2 - Make an all-cash offer with Homeward's funds: Secure your next home by making an all-cash offer with Homeward's funds.3 - Rent your new home from Homeward: Move into your new home and rent it from Homeward for up to six months while you finish selling your existing home.4 - Sell your existing home: List your home for sale when you're ready.

Student debt in the US has skyrocketed to a staggering $1.5 trillion, and every year, more than a million students don't apply for financial aid even though they'd qualify for it. Amira Yahyaoui, previously an influential activist in the Arab Spring in Tunisia, founded Mos to interrupt the cycle of skyrocketing student debt and unused government financial aid. Mos' platform checks over 30,000 eligibility criteria for students to access and aggregate all $135B in potential government aid into one single application.""Students shouldn't have to spend their weekends filling out forms to get grants and scholarships. It's incredibly stressful and all too easy to mess up,"" says Yahyaoui. ""Unfortunately, the easiest way to pay for college today is contracting a big private student loan that can alter the course of a student's life. I believe every student should get every dollar possible in free, no-strings-attached funding before they take on debt.""To help fund their efforts to make financial aid and resources more accessible for students, Mos has raised $13 million in Series A financing in a round led by Sequoia Capital with participation from Stephen Curry, Zoom founder Eric Yuan, Emerson Collective and Lux Capital, among others. Prior investor Uber co-founder Garrett Camp's startup studio Expa also participated in the round. ""Mos opens new doors to students who want to go to college without taking on huge amounts of debt,"" said Jess Lee, partner at Sequoia. ""As COVID-19 impacts the financial futures of American students, there has never been a greater need for them to be empowered and educated around their financial options. We are proud to be partnering with Amira and her team as they help students access financial aid."" Student Rights During COVID-19: The Ultimate GuideIn addition to providing a first-of-its kind application for students seeking financial aid, Mos is directly responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has upended the lives of 20 million college students and 3.7 million high school seniors in the US. The company is launching The Ultimate Guide to COVID-19 for students to address the dearth of easily accessible, consolidated information and resources for students in the time of COVID-19. The free guide provides instructions, templates, and more to help students who have been forced to put their futures on hold, are being charged tuition for no class, evicted from housing with no options, and told to wait indefinitely for admissions and financial aid decisions. Mos created the guide after hearing from students about the anxiety, hardship, and profound uncertainty the crisis has caused. The guide is updated daily, combines knowledge from experts across financial aid and education. Instead of simply providing advice like most articles, it offers a set of email and letter templates that students can use immediately to make effective housing petitions, information requests, payment deferments, and special circumstances appeals. ""The lack of information out there shouldn't cost young people their futures. It doesn't have to be this way,"" says Yahyaoui. ""Students have more rights than they know about to advocate for themselves, seek tuition reimbursements and loan forgiveness, oppose evictions, and get answers to their questions.""From the early days of the crisis, Stephen Curry played an impactful role in raising swift awareness and education around COVID-19. ""This guide is exactly what students need right now- clarity on the ways COVID-19 impacts their education, and what resources are available to them to help navigate the often complex process of financial aid,"" said the six-time NBA All-Star. Millions of students are already eligible for professional judgment appeals related to COVID-19. Mos started by offering the guide to its network of 200,000 students, but wanted to do more to empower the current and future college students of America, so the company is making the guide available to the public and any student, educator or parent looking for resources.

ALS breaks down nerve cells, reducing muscle function and causing loss of muscle control. ALS can be traced to mutations in over 25 different genes and is often caused by a combination of multiple sub-forms of the condition. Its average life expectancy is three years, and there is currently no cure for the disease.About QurAlis CorporationQurAlis is developing precision therapeutics for ALS, a terminal disease that causes muscle paralysis through degeneration of the motor system. We are digging deep into the root causes of the multiple sub-forms of this destructive disease and focus our programs on tackling specific disease-causing mechanisms."

Tock revealed its true grit and entrepreneurial spirit, and is helping thousands of restaurants build a bridge to the future. As restaurants slowly begin to reopen, the combination of Tock's reservations, events, CRM, and carryout functions on a single affordable platform is game changing for the industry.""Tock's core business of reservations, event bookings, and intelligent hospitality tools served nearly 3,000 restaurants, wineries, and pop-ups across 28 countries in over 200 cities as of February. But as Covid-19 struck the vast majority of those businesses were forced to close. Tock's cloud based platform, flexible data structures, and best in class hospitality features enabled the rapid design, build, and deployment of Tock to Go -- built to help restaurants offer pickup and delivery. In April alone Tock added nearly 1,000 new restaurants, allowing them to offer elevated carryout menus and delivery service to millions of Tock diners while safely reemploying their staff. Tock charges a flat 3% for this service, compared to over 25% for many third party delivery apps.""Tock's mission has never waivered,"" said CEO Nick Kokonas. ""We always focus on empowering restaurants to have a better, direct connection with their customers. In doing so we help them provide superior hospitality, increase their sales, and streamline their operations. While we never expected a crisis like this, we know that what worked so well in good times is now critical. Our work has always been rewarding because we love the hospitality industry. Now it is truly important.""To date Tock has seated tens of millions of guests, booked nearly $1 billion of pre-paid reservations, deposits, and events, and has already enabled the service of 1 million To Go meals. As restaurants begin to reopen, Tock will continue to create tools that restaurants need to resume operations, including contactless payment, dual dine-in and carryout service operations, data-driven hospitality reporting, and marketing integrations. Tock is the only system that provides reservation management capacity controls and the ability to offer pickup and/or delivery orders on one unified platform.""Tock is doing well by doing good for the industry,"" said Origin's Jason Heltzer, a Tock board member. ""This is an investment not only in Tock, but in the future of the restaurant industry -- one that we believe will rebound because it is so tied to our collective culture.""About Tock:Launched in December 2014, Tock powers reservation, table management, and carryout operations for nearly 3,000 restaurants ranging from neighborhood pizzerias to Michelin-starred destinations, wineries, and pop-ups in 28 countries.From ordinary reservations to extraordinary experiences, Tock allows guests to discover and book wherever they are - on Google, Instagram, Facebook, Maps, or on the Tock app. Coming soon is Tock Time, the first of its kind digital concierge system for diners.

Historically, the healthcare system has been organized around treating the sick and compensating providers on the volume of services ordered, an arrangement commonly known as fee-for-service. Value-based delivery rewards providers for the quality of care they give to their patients. VBC is important because it emphasizes keeping patients healthy, lowering the overall cost of care, and compensates providers based on outcomes, rather than the quantity of care given to their patients. Stellar Health's cloud-based, point-of-care platform encourages VBC by pushing meaningful, actionable insights right to end users: providers and their practice staff.

Span's smart panel provides intuitive monitoring and controls for all circuits alongside unprecedented flexibility for battery backup during power outages. The Series A round was led by ArcTern Ventures and joined by Capricorn Investment Group, Incite Ventures, and existing investors.""Self-sufficiency and control within the home are top-of-mind for many homeowners with power outage concerns now compounded by coronavirus shelter-in-place orders,"" said Span founder and CEO Arch Rao, who formerly led the product team at Tesla Energy for the Powerwall. ""Last fall, power outages affected millions in California, and shutoffs are starting again as utilities perform precautionary maintenance in fire-risk areas. We developed the Span smart panel to give homeowners greater energy independence in the face of these growing challenges. With Span, they have greater control over their home energy, especially when they need it most.""Delivering much more than the passive current protection of the traditional electrical panels found in every home, the Span smart panel enables digital automation of home energy and more streamlined installations for clean energy upgrades. While the standard electrical panel has not seen major innovation for nearly a century, today's homes are in need of new functionality to better manage modern connected devices, appliances, electronics, and energy upgrades such as solar panels, batteries, and EV charging systems.Span's smart panel provides monitoring and control for 32 circuits, all managed through a smartphone interface. When the power goes out, Span automatically islands the house and allows homeowners to select what parts of their homes they want to power, going far beyond existing solutions that are limited to covering just a few critical loads.The Span panel is listed to UL standards that mirror this step-change in functionality: UL standard 67 for the regular electrical panel as well as UL 916 for energy management equipment and UL 869A for service equipment.For installers performing solar and storage installations, the panel reduces labor by streamlining the total number of components. Early estimates indicate the installation time to be 50 percent faster than current solutions, resulting in fewer components required and a smaller, more streamlined overall installation.Nest co-founder Matt Rogers joined the funding round through Incite Ventures.""We founded Nest to reinvent the largest energy user at home, the thermostat. We replaced an ugly household device with something that invited interaction and saved energy. Span has the potential to solve that for every load in the home.

Since launching the product in late 2019, the company has seen significant demand in the residential market from solar plus storage installers, homebuilders, energy companies, and homeowners. Funding will be used to meet this demand and scale Span's panel to households across the U.S.Managing Partner at ArcTern Ventures Murray McCaig sees massive potential for Span's technology to scale and significantly improve how solar and storage can work for homes.""We see an incredible opportunity in the solar-plus-storage market, one that Span is extremely well-positioned to capitalize on. Span combines this opportunity with an exceptional team and a deep understanding of the market.""Dipender Saluja, Managing Director at Capricorn Investment Group's Technology Impact Fund and an early investor in Tesla, sees Span's combination of engineering innovation and consumer focus as a strong parallel.""We have seen the tremendous impact new hardware technologies can have in transforming incumbent industries. I am excited to partner with Arch to deliver a much needed revolution to electrical infrastructure and the distributed energy market.""Existing investors are aligned around a similar drive to help scale the growing solar and storage market. Paul Straub of Wireframe Ventures led Span's seed round investment and sees Span as a critical next step to advance distributed clean energy.""Span seamlessly integrates into the home and helps consumers get the most out of solar and storage,"" says Straub. ""It will play a central role as more homeowners seek clean energy, flexible backup power, greater resiliency, and easy control of their homes.""In addition to the new investment round, Mary Powell, former CEO of Vermont utility Green Mountain Power and a leader in transforming the energy system to be better distributed to homes, businesses, and communities, will join Span's board as an independent member.""Mary Powell is one of the most forward-thinking energy executives I've had the privilege of working with,"" says Span CEO Arch Rao. ""She set an example of what a customer-focused utility could look like, bringing the Tesla Powerwall to thousands of customers in the state of Vermont. I'm excited to work with her again as we bring our panel to market.""Span has established channel partnerships with solar and storage installers, as well as leading battery storage providers like LG Chem to commercialize the product.

Vise will use the funding to accelerate the growth of advisor partnerships and product development.""The registered investment advisor (RIA) landscape is increasingly fragmented as advisors break away from large financial institutions to become independent, and we built Vise to support this new generation of advisor-entrepreneurs,"" said Runik Mehrotra, co-founder and Chief Investment Officer of Vise. ""In the same way Shopify enabled artisans to compete against Amazon, or how Airbnb allowed homeowners to launch their own businesses, Vise is giving independent advisers the tools they need to succeed.""AI continues to make inroads across the financial services sector, but most of the $84T wealth management industry, which has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 8.2% since 2001, still runs on legacy software. Vise is designed to fill that gap. Powered by cutting edge natural language processing, Vise builds customized portfolios for every client and helps advisors tell a compelling story to their clients with key talking points, including the ""why"" behind portfolio decisions.""Vise enters the RIA space at a critical time for the wealth management industry,"" said Keith Rabois, partner at Founders Fund. ""Whereas actively managed mutual funds and robo-advisors are both struggling to provide competitive risk-adjusted returns and sufficient downside protection, Vise was designed to help advisors thrive amid volatility and uncertainty.""""Rarely have I met founders as talented as Samir and Runik, and never with tailwinds as compelling as with Vise,"" said Shaun Maguire, partner at Sequoia. ""This is one of the biggest markets on Earth currently being revolutionized by the perfect storm of consumers pushing for more personalization, advisors seeking advanced technology so they can be even better at their jobs, and the industry moving towards zero-commission trades. This creates an opportunity to rethink decades of institutional wisdom and puts them in a prime position to be the central nervous system of the wealth management industry.""About ViseFounded in 2016, by Samir Vasavada and Runik Mehrotra, Vise automates investment management for financial advisors using artificial intelligence. Vise has built a full-stack platform spanning the entire lifecycle of the advisor-client relationship, including designing personalized portfolios for clients, managing portfolios, and providing on-going intelligence. By doing so, Vise helps financial advisors focus on their most valuable resource -- their client relationships. Vise is headquartered in New York City and is backed by top Silicon Valley venture funds Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund and Bling Capital.About SequoiaSequoia helps daring founders build legendary companies from idea to IPO and beyond. We spur founders to push the boundaries of what's possible. In partnering with Sequoia, companies benefit from 48 years of tribal knowledge from working with founders like Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Larry Page, Jan Koum, Brian Chesky, Drew Houston, Adi Tatarko, Julia Hartz and Jack Dorsey. In aggregate, Sequoia-backed companies account for more than 20% of NASDAQ's total value. From the beginning, the vast majority of money we invest has been on behalf of non-profits and schools like the Ford Foundation, Mayo Clinic and MIT, which means founders' accomplishments make a meaningful difference."

In addition to expanding its manufacturing capacity, GreenLight is developing several differentiated mRNA vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. This initiative is an integral part of the company's expansion into life sciences, which include efforts to develop a large-scale vaccine platform targeting seasonal and pandemic influenza, and rapid response to emerging viruses, such as the novel coronavirus.mRNA-based vaccines offer the potential to address pandemics because of shorter pre-clinical development times compared to traditional vaccines. This has allowed GreenLight to quickly prepare a set of COVID-19 vaccine candidates for laboratory and pre-clinical evaluation of their safety and efficacy.This round of funding is aimed at establishing a scaled process under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), capable of supporting clinical development and enabling the production of billions of doses of COVID-19 vaccine using GreenLight's proprietary bioprocessing technology. Participating investors include Flu Lab, Xeraya Capital, and Baird Capital.  ""GreenLight's team and technology make them uniquely positioned to quickly bring large-scale, practical solutions to market for rapid pandemic response,"" said Mike Liang, Partner at Baird Capital. ""GreenLight's approach promises the billions of doses needed with significantly faster manufacturing times than other technology platforms. Baird Capital believes GreenLight has the potential to be a critical part of us getting back to a healthy, functioning economy in the shortest possible time, and we are proud to support this team of talented scientists and researchers in their efforts.""With this latest round of funding, GreenLight is accelerating the research and development of its fully integrated mRNA production capability and product platform. Currently, there is limited global capacity to supply mRNA doses in mass quantities. With global experts predicting the potential need for billion of doses of vaccine, GreenLight is building the scalable biomanufacturing capacity to quickly address the needs of a pandemic response.""An effective vaccine against COVID-19 is the only realistic means to stave off the spread of COVID-19 and enable a re-start of our global societies and economies. mRNA based vaccines offer the best approach for a fast response,"" said Dr. Andrey Zarur, CEO of GreenLight. ""Our mRNA manufacturing platform has the potential to produce any mRNA vaccine candidate at a global scale and affordable cost. It is our responsibility to rapidly establish our cGMP manufacturing process to enable broad production of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. In addition, we are developing novel mRNA sequences to ensure we will be able to effectively respond to this crisis. Our vaccine platform and COVID-19 efforts are a significant component of our broader efforts in human health, where we are pursuing solutions against a number of critical global health needs. Our mission is to enable the global and affordable production of mRNA solutions.""mRNA acts as an intermediary between the genetic information in DNA and the amino acid sequence of proteins. Unlike existing vaccines, which typically use weakened or dead forms of a pathogen or recombinant proteins, mRNA vaccines carry instructions such that injected cells themselves produce the target antigen, simulating a viral infection and stimulating immune responses against the pathogen.

To date, adult consumers age 21 and older have been able to purchase Black Buffalo's smokeless tobacco alternative products online at BlackBuffalo.com.Black Buffalo was founded in 2015, and the company has invested over 20,000 hours of research and development into creating Black Buffalo's eight products, which include five long-cut and three pouches varieties, all of which contain pharmaceutical-grade nicotine but no tobacco leaf or tobacco stem.  ""Black Buffalo's products were developed by a team that collectively dipped traditional smokeless tobacco products for over 60 years,"" says co-founder and President Mark Hanson, ""and our guiding principle has always been that dipping is about much more than just nicotine delivery.  It's also about the ritual: from the crack of the seal, to the look and feel of the high-definition embossed tin, to the rich, moist flavor of that first pinch or pouch.  We believe that Black Buffalo offers the first true alternative for adult consumers looking to make the switch from traditional dip, as evidenced by our tens of thousands of customers.""With proceeds from this capital raise, Black Buffalo has assembled Premarket Tobacco Product Applications for its entire product portfolio, which the company intends to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center for Tobacco Products in the coming months.  Additionally, Black Buffalo has purchased and expects Q2 2020 delivery of a high-throughput pouch maker from one of the world's leading industrial manufacturers.  Adding this equipment will enable the company to continue to satisfy demand from its adult customer base, of which nearly half are regular consumers of pouches products.  Black Buffalo's sales have exhibited strong growth in 2020, with month-over-month revenue growth of 31% in March 2020 and 23% in April 2020.  ""One of the best parts of our initial e-commerce strategy has been having a direct relationship with our customers, whom we affectionately call 'the Herd.'  Black Buffalo will always lead with product, but we're equally excited about the opportunity to continue to build upon our already strong brand,"" says co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer Jeffery David.In late April 2020, Black Buffalo announced that Donald ""Cowboy"" Cerrone, one of the most well-known and respected fighters in mixed martial arts, has joined the Herd as an official brand ambassador (Cowboy can be found online as @Cowboycerrone across major social media platforms).  Additionally, Black Buffalo has continued to make key hires and investments during the first half of 2020, including hiring Matthew Hanson as Chief Growth Officer, upgrading the company's marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and implementing transformative company-wide initiatives to support continued rapid growth.  ""We have reviewed numerous potential consumer branded goods investments, and we are thrilled to partner with Black Buffalo,"" says Pendyne Capital's Co-Chief Investment Officer Bo Ramsey.  ""We believe Black Buffalo has the potential to capture substantial market share in the nearly $7.5 billion moist smokeless tobacco category, for which we believe no true alternative has existed to date for adult consumers.""Robert Buhler, President and CEO of Open Pantry Food Marts, says, ""The alternative nicotine category has seen explosive growth over the past few years in the convenience store channel.  We believe that Black Buffalo has the potential to be a category leader with its exceptional product portfolio of oral tobacco alternatives.

The report has been cited by government officials, cybersecurity experts, and in news and media around the world. This round of funding will allow Finite State to scale its team of world-class engineers, whose mission is focused on advancing the company's cutting-edge technology that enables unprecedented visibility into device firmware. With its focus on users and manufacturers of connected devices in the energy, telecommunications, and national security sectors, an expanded team will give Finite State the bandwidth to secure some of the world's most critical infrastructure.""The exponential growth of connected devices powering our critical infrastructure is driving attackers to change their tactics and target these more vulnerable devices,"" said Matt Wyckhouse, Founder and CEO of Finite State. ""Finite State focuses on creating transparency within supply chains, so manufacturers and end users can work together to mitigate vulnerabilities before they are exploited.""""The proliferation of internet of things (IoT) devices has enabled a smarter and more resilient electric grid. As operators rapidly deploy IoT devices for critical industrial and business functions, the stakes have never been higher for security teams to keep up with the risks and vulnerabilities that exist within these devices,"" said Sameer Reddy, partner at EIP. ""We're excited to partner with Finite State as the company brings its platform to the energy sector to provide operators with exceptional, real-time intelligence of supply chain risk.""""Finite State takes a uniquely data-driven approach to discovering vulnerabilities in the IoT fabric that now powers every part of the economy from transportation to health care to fundamental infrastructure,"" said Jocelyn Goldfein of Zetta Venture Partners. Zetta was also among the company's initial investors. She goes on to say that ""IoT represents the new frontier of cyber attacks, and Finite State's unique threat intelligence is an invaluable assist for defenders."" PRIORITIZING SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITYThe complexity of supply chains for connected devices makes it extremely difficult to know whether or not a device is truly secure. Because device manufacturers source parts and software from many different vendors, it is challenging for them to understand and mitigate the risks their devices pose without extensive testing. Through firmware analysis on behalf of device manufacturers and their customers, Finite State's platform is able to automatically scan each device and provide an in-depth analysis into the device's firmware, including the presence of known vulnerabilities, potential backdoors, supply chain threats, and other crucial information that affects the overall risk of each device. This information is key to allowing end users to understand and mitigate the risk presented by each device, and it allows OEMs to address and resolve these issues and share the risk analysis with their customers. This transparency is the key to creating more secure supply chains and ensuring safer networks in all industries from utilities to manufacturing, healthcare to government systems.ABOUT FINITE STATEThe mission of Finite State is to protect the devices that power our modern lives by illuminating the vulnerabilities and threats within their complex software supply chains. With backgrounds in the U.S. Intelligence Community, our team has the unique perspective to be able to understand the intricacies of hidden risk in connected devices. Finite State is headquartered in the heart of the Midwest in Columbus, Ohio.

Clinical data have shown the ability of this technology to detect more than 50 cancer types with a very low false positive rate of less than one percent. GRAIL's test was designed to minimize false positives in order to limit associated harms, including patient anxiety and unnecessary diagnostic workups. When a cancer signal is detected, the test has been able to identify where in the body the cancer is located with high accuracy, an important step to guiding diagnostic next steps and care.GRAIL's methylation-based technology preferentially targets the most informative regions of the genome and is designed to use its proprietary database and machine-learning algorithms to both detect the presence of cancer and identify the tumor's tissue of origin. GRAIL believes its sequencing database of cancer and non-cancer methylation signatures is the largest of its kind.About GRAILGRAIL is a healthcare company whose mission is to detect cancer early, when it can be cured. GRAIL is focused on alleviating the global burden of cancer by developing pioneering technology to detect and identify multiple deadly cancer types early.

With this, Illumina's Nick Naclerio, founding partner, and HLM's Steven Tolle, partner, will be joining LetsGetChecked's board as members.WHAT IT DOESFounded in 2014, LetsGetChecked provides consumer customers with a range of at-home testing kits, such as ones for hormone levels, sexually transmitted infections, liver performance, nutrition and - specifically for frontline healthcare workers - COVID-19.Customers receive their kit in the mail, with which they collect and return a personal sample for testing. One of the startup's lab partners analyzes the sample and returns it to a LetsGetChecked physician, who reviews the results and counsels customers - over the phone, if necessary. For later reference, test results are saved in a LetsGetChecked patient app that interfaces with Apple Health, Fitbit, Garmin and other consumer-friendly health tools.As of March, the company has also been offering a COVID-19 ""twin-track"" antibody and PCR test exclusive to providers working at the point of care. However, the company said it hopes to release a direct-to-consumer version of the testing kit down the road.""The company's work has never been more important now that the world faces a global pandemic, forcing us all to re-evaluate how we obtain health and wellness services,"" Illumina's Naclerio said in a statement. ""LetsGetChecked is already having a profound impact on patient-led at-home healthcare, which is necessary now and will become increasingly common in the future.""WHAT IT'S FORThe company said these funds will help build up its manufacturing, supply and testing capacity for COVID-19.

""With the onset of COVID-19, we realigned resources with a view to helping with this global pandemic and are currently delivering tens of thousands of tests per day to critical and frontline healthcare workers""MARKET SNAPSHOTConsumer-facing home testing startups were already picking up momentum around the time of LetsGetChecked's $30 million Series B, with competitors like EverlyWell, healthy.io and Scanwell Health all announcing new rounds or services over the course of the last year. However, COVID-19 has ramped up demand across the industry and led to some confusion with the FDA on more than one occasion. But the window for these companies to take their COVID-19 tests directly to consumers appears to be reopening: It was just a few weeks ago that LabCorp's COVID-19 RT-PCR test became the first permitted for at-home sample collection.ON THE RECORD""HLM invests in companies that inherently drive adoption due to the need they serve, and companies that leverage important market trends,"" Tolle said in a statement. ""In this case, LetsGetChecked is helping to improve consumer access to care, which is increasingly essential."""

As part of the deal, Lime will acquire Uber's Jump bike-sharing business operations and the two companies will expand the integration of their mobile apps.The investment round valued Lime at $400 million, a person familiar with the terms said, asking not to be identified because they're private. That's a massive drop from the $2.4 billion investors priced the company at in a funding round last year. Lime didn't comment on the valuation in the statement.Venture capitalists have invested more than $1 billion in the last few years in two startups renting electric scooters -- Lime and Bird -- but they began falling out of favor this year. First unprofitable business models fell out of fashion, and then the pandemic kept customers stuck at home. Both companies had to drastically reduce their fleets by mid-March.Lime said in January it was cutting 14% of staff, about 100 employees, and retreating from a dozen markets in a drive toward profitability. In March it said it was ""winding down or pausing"" service in all markets but South Korea. And in April, further job cuts were announced.Lime said its chief executive officer, Brad Bao, would be replaced by Wayne Ting, previously the company's head of operations. Bao will continue as board chairman.Global self-isolation measures and government bans on travel had decimated Lime's ability to generate revenue from the hundreds of thousands of scooters it has around the world. The company went from 147,000 scooter trips globally on March 14 to about 52,000 three days later as Europe went into lockdown.Scooter companies are also suffering from a sharp decline in transportation spending and a newfound aversion to the sharing economy. This combination of factors is also weighing heavily on Airbnb Inc., Getaround Inc., Lyft Inc. and Uber. Lyft said Wednesday that it's cutting 17% of its workforce."

Not only does Emtrain's solution meet increasing state and federal compliance training regulations, but it also diagnoses issues that are otherwise invisible to business leaders and benchmarks those issues against a global average so that internal stakeholders know where to focus their time and attention for maximum and measurable results. The diagnostic tool and data provide a win/win for employers and employees who both want to prevent these issues but lack the visibility, tools and organizational structure to do so effectively.Emtrain's recently launched Emtrain.ai solution has already collected over seven million employee sentiment responses about core culture indicators that exist in organizations such as power dynamics; in-group/out-group dynamics; unconscious biases and other indicators that correlate with a higher risk for bad culture outcomes. The company's initial report, Emtrain's 2020 Workplace Culture Report, published in March, shows that only 17% of employees will report sexual harassment to HR if they see or experience it.  Other data is consistent in that it shows employees don't typically report problems. The result is these problems remain invisible to HR and compliance leaders until there's an explosive incident that rocks the culture. ""Our changing demographics, social norms and current tough business climate require a better solution to educate employees of their rights and responsibilities and how to be a culture leader while informing employers where they need to focus their time and attention to support a healthy culture,"" said Janine Yancey, Founder and CEO of Emtrain. ""U.S. businesses spend five billion dollars each year on compliance training without getting real business value; no business intelligence, no benchmarking, no evidence of behavior modification, nothing but a completion certificate. Business leaders are increasingly demanding business value from these programs and a way to solve behavioral problems before they turn into bad outcomes. Emtrain uses data, analytics, and benchmarking to show companies where they are vulnerable and how to address their hotspots in a proactive way.""""Janine has a bold, unique vision on how to change the way organizations identify their risk and prevent complex culture issues from becoming damaging,"" said EGP Managing Partner Peter Campbell. ""Janine Yancey and her team have developed their predictive frameworks and data sets over 15 years, and have now built a breakthrough product that anticipates where the market has moved.

The round was led by Index Ventures, along with AI-focused Radical Ventures and participation from existing investor Amplify Partners and others. Covariant will use the funding to accelerate its partnerships, introduce AI Robotics to new industries, and grow its research, engineering and commercial teams.From food distribution to healthcare to e-commerce, the global supply chain is facing unprecedented pressure to deliver orders quickly, reliably and efficiently, while keeping workers safe. Automation is the key to meeting those challenges.While repetitive and predictable tasks like the movement of goods have successfully been automated, complex and unpredictable tasks that require hands, such as picking, placing and unloading, have not. Traditional automation can't handle the constant change and infinite variability of these tasks. Automating them requires advanced AI that can understand, learn and adapt.Founded in 2017, Covariant is building the Covariant Brain, universal AI that enables robots to see, reason and act autonomously in the real world. Covariant robots learn general abilities such as robust 3D perception, physical affordances of objects, few-shot learning and real-time motion planning which gives them the intelligence to learn how to manipulate new objects they've never seen before in environments where they've never operated.In January 2020, Covariant launched from stealth to reveal that it had reached a new AI milestone: its AI Robotics stations were running consistently at customer facilities in North America and Europe in the apparel, pharmaceutical and electronics industries, and had achieved autonomy in live production, with a mean unassisted operating time greater than one hour.""When we founded Covariant, our goal was to make AI Robotics work autonomously in the real world,"" said Pieter Abbeel, Covariant's President, Chief Scientist and co-founder. ""Having reached that milestone, we see a huge benefit in expanding our universal AI to new use cases, customer environments and industries.""The funding comes on the heels of significant momentum for the company. Soon after launching from stealth, Covariant invested in strategic partnerships to accelerate the deployment of robotic stations to customers. In February, Covariant announced a partnership with ABB, a leading industrial robotics supplier. In March, Covariant joined forces with Knapp, a leading supplier of intralogistics systems.""As the coronavirus crisis has exposed serious frailty in the global supply chain, we're seeing more demand than ever for our AI Robotics solutions,"" said Peter Chen, Covariant CEO and co-founder. ""Our customers are eager to invest in AI and scale it across their supply chains to meet growing demands and more stringent requirements. This latest funding round, along with our recent partnerships, will allow us to scale quickly across multiple industries.""As a part of the investment, Mike Volpi, partner at Index Ventures, will be joining Covariant's board.""We've been blown away by Covariant's team of world-class AI researchers and roboticists and the universal AI they've built,"" said Mike Volpi, partner at Index Ventures.

Next Coast Ventures led the round with participation from Meridian Street Capital.Additional investors in the round include former athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush, Everlywell CEO Julia Cheek, Bright Health CTO Brian Gambs and Capital Factory. The funding will be used to recruit a top team of engineers and designers to scale the HSA offering and build new functionality for First Dollar's platform.Today, the nation's more than 26 million Health Savings Accounts control $61.7 billion in assets, but the healthcare industry is the primary beneficiary of that total. Most users allow their contributions to sit idle, turning a potential investment vehicle into an under-utilized bank account. Only 11% of participants maximize their contributions each year, and only 13% invest their HSA savings for growth. Even worse, many HSAs charge a monthly fee, so savings are slowly depleted by as much as $100 per year.Empowering Consumers with a Modern Health Care Savings Account PlatformTo solve these problems, First Dollar co-founders Jason Bornhorst and Colin Anawaty set about building an HSA people will actually use. There are no monthly fees, and there will be a heavy focus on easy-to-understand language, education on how to maximize savings and an offering of high-quality health care products at fair prices. No other company offers this complete ecosystem.""HSAs are the worst-marketed health care benefit in the United States,"" said Bornhorst, First Dollar CEO. ""Most of them are effectively little-used bank accounts. We're building a product that not only helps you maximize your savings but also offers great health care at a great price. We believe that for every $1 you put into your First Dollar HSA, you should get $2 in value back in savings and spending.""""I've been an HSA user for years, and it's an amazing tool if you know how to use it,"" said Anawaty, First Dollar's chief product officer. ""The products on the market, though, don't live up to the power of the HSA. I'm excited to build a product that people will love that makes their finances healthier and also helps them make more informed decisions about their long-term health.""First Dollar targets Millennials and Gen Z, a generally healthy population that typically spends too much per year for more coverage than they need. Only 1 in 5 people in those demographics reach their deductible amount each year. First Dollar believes they would be better served by putting the money they spend on premiums into a simple, informative, 100% fee-free HSA account.Investor Perspectives on First Dollar Seed Funding Round""Two of the biggest concerns on people's minds today are their money and their health,"" said Mike Smerklo, Next Coast Ventures co-founder and managing partner. ""In an ever-changing healthcare market, it pays to have leaders who know the space.

Marketing techniques that were once considered ""old school"" are now ""new again,"" as savvy B2B marketers leverage Postal to manage and measure offline campaigns for maximum return.Given that most people are working from home 24/7, the need for solutions like Postal is particularly urgent, because email marketing shows a continued diminishing rate of return. According to industry experts, post-pandemic email marketing volume is up, while response rates remain at near or all-time lows. The current market environment underscores and truly sets the stage for technologies like Postal, which enables marketers to deliver personalized customer and prospect touches at scale. From campaign creation to delivery, Postal drives conversions by leveraging machine learning, customizable workflows and human-like personalization, which lead to experiences and relationships at scale.""What Marketo, Eloqua and HubSpot did for digital marketing automation, Postal is doing for offline marketing automation, particularly in an era when person-to-person connections have become increasingly difficult, yet remain very important,"" said Kostelnik, also CEO of Postal.io. ""Our platform is designed to create authentic, tactile offline customer connections that help brands drive profitable customer relationships, even in turbulent times. We partnered with Mayfield for their people-first approach and experience in helping build SaaS companies from inception to industry leaders. They also deeply understand customer facing applications, given their successful investments such as Marketo, Outreach, ServiceMax and others.""Proceeds from this Series A investment will be used to grow the Postal team in San Luis Obispo and to scale revenue operations. ""For us at Mayfield, it always starts with the founders, their values and vision and desire and potential to build a great Company,"" said Rajeev Batra, Mayfield Partner and Postal.io board member. ""We met Erik and Jed over five years ago when they were working on their first startup together, TextRecruit, which connected job seekers with employers. It was a lesson in enabling personalized human connections at scale. After TextRecruit's successful acquisition, Erik and Jed wanted to build Postal to enable a similar connection between companies and customers leveraging the offline channel, which has been overlooked as the world moved to digital. They are seamlessly combining the best of both worlds which is a massive opportunity and resonates in this unusual time.""Postal gives its clients the ability to scale offline marketing with the ease and speed of digital, and early-adopter customers are seeing the benefit of merging online and offline communication to increase overall conversion rates.Unlike antiquated, manual and un-trackable processes for offline direct mail and gifting campaigns, Postal provides its clients with the ability to manage and report on offline campaigns just as effectively as they can with digital marketing programs. ""Personal handwritten notes and prospect gifting have always been a key part of our enterprise strategy,"" said Zero Keyboard CEO Braden Golub. ""Now we can finally scale and track these efforts with Postal.""According to Erik Hayden, Founder and Managing Partner of Urban Catalyst, ""As the fastest-growing Opportunity Zone Investment Fund in California, we use Postal to customize, personalize and automate all direct mail to our potential investors. We have seen a significant increase in our overall conversion rates as we merge our digital efforts with this new offline platform.""More About the Postal.io PlatformThanks to the rapid adoption of marketing automation technologies, the era of digital sales and marketing has achieved critical mass.

CockroachDB is a distributed relational database that is scalable, survivable, and strongly consistent - hence the name. It combines the rich functionality of SQL with the horizontal scalability common to NoSQL offerings, and provides enterprise-grade disaster recovery. The company was founded in 2015 with a mission to Make Data Easy.",Series D,"$86,600,000",05 May 2020,Cockroach Labs Lands $86.6M Series D Round,https://vcnewsdaily.com/cockroach-labs/venture-capital-funding/cwgsjrkzdy,"NEW YORK, NY, Cockroach Labs, the company behind CockroachDB, the leading enterprise-grade distributed SQL database, today announced $86.6 million in Series D funding.",New York,NY,https://vcnewsdaily.com/Cockroach%20Labs/venture-funding.php,"The round was co-led by Altimeter Capital and BOND with participation from Benchmark, GV, Index Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Sequoia Capital and Tiger Capital.This round brings Cockroach Labs' total funding to $195 million. Worldwide stay-at-home orders have dramatically increased demand for many businesses, putting increasing stress on the modern tech stack. Economic uncertainty is encouraging greater efficiency, setting the stage for further migration away from legacy, closed-source data platforms to modern, distributed, cloud-native tools. This round of funding will facilitate Cockroach Labs' growing investments in R&D to better support customers as they change to meet these new requirements. Enterprises in areas including communications, gaming and entertainment, e-commerce and financial services are scrambling to support increased consumer demand and remote workforces, and are finding that the resiliency and flexibility necessary to do so just isn't available without an elastically scalable, multi-cloud, modern data platform like CockroachDB.Since its inception in 2016, the CockroachDB next-generation SQL database has helped organizations move and manage critical transactional data in the cloud. The software has developed an ardent and loyal following among architects, developers, and academics by capitalizing on the failed cloud migration promises of legacy database players and the risks associated with ""lock-in"" from the large public cloud vendors. This has resulted in year-over-year commercial customer growth of 295 percent. And once these users found what they were looking for in CockroachDB, they have doubled-down-first-year customers have, on average, expanded their usage 2x, and have renewed at a rate of over 90 percent.Today, Fortune 500 CIOs are taking notice: while CockroachDB has only been available for two years, it is already in use at some of the world's largest enterprises across all industries, including Equifax, Bose and Comcast. More businesses are turning to CockroachDB to help in both expanding to meet new demand, reducing costs, and moving to the cloud. A recent survey of open roles, specifically for CockroachDB developers, on LinkedIn shows over 40 positions at 25 of the top enterprise companies across industries. Companies include Apple, Honey, Facebook, Tesla and Via.""The migration to a multi-cloud environment has long been underway at many, if not all, of the top global enterprises. What cannot be taken for granted in the rush to the cloud is resiliency and scalability, which is near impossible to do without a distributed database that is elastic and self-healing,"" said CEO and co-founder of Cockroach Labs, Spencer Kimball. ""It's a given that this is the way of the future. But as that future approaches faster than many expected it is putting immense pressure on the enterprise to make this leap now, as quickly and effortlessly as possible. CockroachDB was purpose-built for mission-critical, data-intensive, cloud-deployed applications, and as a result, we are seeing a tremendous increase in demand for our services from companies small and large looking for bulletproof resiliency, effortless scalability and an overall more cost-effective platform.""A Massive Market, Ripe for Disruption""The cloud has provided the opportunity to rethink all aspects of IT infrastructure and software,"" explained Tony Baer, principal at dbinsight. ""CockroachDB is a prime example of how the cloud is reinventing databases, removing traditional shackles to scale and volume that have constrained them, clearing the way for new forms of globally-distributed applications that weren't thinkable before.""The worldwide public cloud services market is forecasted to grow nearly 20 percent in 2020 to a total upwards of $260 billion, according to an analyst firm. It also expects that by 2022, 75 percent of all databases (which saw 18.4 percent of growth in revenue in 2018) will be deployed or migrated to a cloud platform. With double-digit growth in the database market, this represents a larger move away from legacy players like Oracle as companies look for more nimble cloud-native databases. Amidst such growth, the greatest innovation is coming from companies that arose out of the open-source software movement, many of which are poised to disrupt slower-moving players operating on either decades-old technology or on an assembly of services cobbled together via acquisition. As the world's first cloud-native, distributed SQL database, Cockroach Labs is the only player in the space built from the ground up with the needs of the global enterprise in mind.""Legacy players have long dominated the enterprise software market. With recent investments in companies like Confluent, Snowflake, and now Cockroach Labs, we're seeing huge market disruption as enterprises move to the cloud and build on a modern tech stack, replacing legacy companies, who are struggling to adapt,"" said Kevin Wang, partner at Altimeter Capital. ""Cockroach Labs is leading this next evolution with a world-class team, ambitious vision, and a transformative product. It's a great time to be in the cloud business.""Cockroach most recently closed a $55 million Series C financing round last summer to invest in hiring new talent-doubling its headcount over the past twelve months-and furthering research and development.About Cockroach LabsCockroach Labs helps organizations migrate and manage critical transactional data in the cloud with their next-generation SQL database.

PulmonX,"Pulmonx is the world leader in interventional pulmonology diagnostics, planning tools, and treatments for obstructive lung disease.",Venture,"$66,000,000",05 May 2020,Pulmonx Announces $66M Funding Round,https://vcnewsdaily.com/pulmonx/venture-capital-funding/dpsgtnnhtl,"REDWOOD CITY, CA, Pulmonx has announced a $66 million financing.",Redwood City,CA,https://vcnewsdaily.com/Pulmonx/venture-funding.php,"Pulmonx, a commercial-stage medical technology company that provides a minimally-invasive treatment for patients with severe emphysema, announces a $66 million financing led by Ally Bridge Group, a leading global life science investor. The financing also attracted new investors Adage Capital Management, HealthQuest Capital, Partner Fund Management, and Rock Springs Capital, as well as existing investors. In addition, $17 million in growth capital was secured through CIBC Innovation Banking to refinance an existing debt facility.Proceeds from this financing will ensure that Pulmonx is well-capitalized to support the continued global commercial expansion of the Zephyr Valve System, the first FDA-approved minimally-invasive treatment option for severe emphysema, a form of COPD. The Zephyr Valve procedure, done through a simple bronchoscopy with no incision or tissue resection, is clinically proven to improve patients' breathing, exercise capacity, and quality of life, without the risks of major surgery.1""Ally Bridge is pleased to support Pulmonx in this oversubscribed financing,"" said Frank Yu, Founder, CEO and CIO of Ally Bridge Group. ""The combination of Pulmonx' Zephyr Valve System, patient assessment tools, established reimbursement programs, and global commercial footprint positions it as the world leader in interventional COPD procedures.""Emphysema is a progressive and life-threatening form of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and represents about 25% of all COPD patients. In the United States, COPD is the third leading cause of death and is expected to be associated with approximately $49 billion in direct medical costs in 2020. Emphysema is a debilitating and life-threatening disease that progressively destroys lung tissue, resulting in a diminishing ability to breathe and engage in the most basic daily activities, leading to further deconditioning and to a high mortality rate. It is estimated that more than 1.2M severe emphysema patients in the US, Europe and Japan are candidates for the Zephyr Valve treatment. Medical therapy delivers limited benefit in later stage patients, and because of the high risks and limited availability, surgical options are only available for a narrow patient population.""We are pleased to be able to accelerate our efforts to bring our landmark technology to severe emphysema patients who need it,"" said Glen French, CEO of Pulmonx. ""The recently secured financing will ensure we are able to continue to scale our commercialization efforts to meet the global demand for our Zephyr Valve System, as well as continue R&D efforts on new minimally-invasive pulmonary treatments.""About Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction with the Zephyr ValveBronchoscopic lung volume reduction with the Zephyr Valve is a one-time procedure performed through a bronchoscope, which requires no cutting or incisions. During the procedure, an average of four valves are placed in the airways to block off a diseased portion of the lung. The target area then reduces in size and allows adjacent healthier lung tissue to expand and function more efficiently. This results in patients being able to breathe more easily and experience less shortness of breath. Many patients treated with the Zephyr Valves have reported immediate relief and the ability to go back to doing everyday tasks with greater ease within weeks of treatment. Data from four published randomized controlled clinical studies have proven that the Zephyr Valve delivers significant and persistent improvement in pulmonary function, exercise capacity, breathlessness, and quality of life with less morbidity and mortality than surgical treatment options.2,3,4,5 These data have led to the inclusion of Zephyr Valves in several national and global treatment guidelines including the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellent (NICE) and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) which gives endobronchial valves a level 'A' evidence rating, the highest rating possible.About Pulmonx CorporationPulmonx is the global leader in interventional procedures for the treatment of COPD. It develops and markets non-surgical technologies for the assessment and treatment of patients with severe emphysema, a progressive and life-threatening form of COPD. The Pulmonx solution, which is comprised of the Zephyr Endobronchial Valve (Zephyr Valve), the Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System (Chartis System) and the StratX Lung Analysis Platform, is designed to treat severe emphysema patients who, despite medical management, are still profoundly symptomatic and either do not want or are ineligible for surgical approaches. The technology is supported by a compelling body of clinical evidence including over 100 published scientific articles regarding the clinical benefits of Zephyr Valves. FDA granted the Zephyr Valve a ""breakthrough device"" designation, and in June 2018 Pulmonx received FDA pre-market approval to commercialize our Zephyr Valve. The Zephyr Valve is now commercially available and physicians in more than 25 countries around the world routinely use the Zephyr Valves to improve the lives of patients with severe emphysema, with over 76,000 valves used to treat more than 19,000 patients worldwide to date.In addition to the Zephyr Valve System, the Company is planning further clinical trials of AeriSealÂ®, a foam-based lung sealant delivered through a bronchoscope to treat the subset of advanced emphysema that cannot be treated with the Zephyr valve.

The financing will also enable Immunomic to expand its team and infrastructure to support the future growth of the company.In addition, ITI and HLB intend to establish an Asian Brain Cancer Research Center in Seoul that will bring together the world's leading experts and cutting-edge science to advance research in the GBM field and to deploy ITI-1000 to the Asian population. ITI-1000 is a cell therapy powered by ITI's UNITE platform that is currently being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial (ATTAC-II) in collaboration with researchers at the University of Florida (Dr. Duane Mitchell) and Duke University (Dr. John Sampson). ITI-1001 is an alternative, cell-free approach to treating GBM. The company held a successful pre-IND meeting earlier this year for ITI-1001 and expects to be able to file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of 2020.Concurrent with the financing, five (5) members from HLB Co., LTD will be joining the Immunomic Therapeutics Board of Directors.About UNITEITI's investigational UNITE platform, or UNiversal Intracellular Targeted Expression, works by fusing pathogenic antigens with the Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein, an endogenous protein in humans, for immune processing. In this way, ITI's vaccines (DNA or RNA) have the potential to utilize the body's natural biochemistry to develop a broad immune response including antibody production, cytokine release and critical immunological memory. This approach could put UNITE technology at the crossroads of immunotherapies in a number of illnesses, including cancer, allergy and infectious diseases. UNITE is currently being employed in Phase II clinical trials as a cancer immunotherapy. ITI is also collaborating with academic centers and biotechnology companies to study the use of UNITE in cancer types of high mortality, including cases where there are limited treatment options like glioblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia. ITI believes that these early clinical studies may provide a proof of concept for UNITE therapy in cancer, and if successful, set the stage for future studies, including combinations in these tumor types and others. Preclinical data is currently being developed to explore whether LAMP nucleic acid constructs may amplify and activate the immune response in highly immunogenic tumor types and be used to create immune responses to tumor types that otherwise do not provoke an immune response.About Immunomic Therapeutics, Inc.Immunomic Therapeutics, Inc. (ITI) is a privately-held, clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of vaccines through its proprietary technology platform, UNiversal Intracellular Targeted Expression (UNITE), which is designed to utilize the body's natural biochemistry to develop vaccines that generate broad immune responses. UNITE has a robust history of applications in various therapeutic areas, including infectious diseases, oncology, allergy and autoimmune diseases. ITI is primarily focused on applying the UNITE platform to oncology, where it could potentially have broad applications, including viral antigens, cancer antigens, neoantigens and antigen-derived antibodies as biologics. The Company has built a large pipeline from UNITE with six oncology programs and two allergy programs. ITI has entered into a significant allergy partnership with Astellas Pharma and has formed several academic collaborations with leading Immuno-oncology researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute, Johns Hopkins University of Medicine, and Duke University. ITI maintains its headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. For more information, please visit www.immunomix.com."

With this new funding, Pivot Bio will accelerate its plans to scale its first-to-market microbial nitrogen technology that increases crop yields and farmer revenue. The technology will also aid in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and global energy use related to the $65 billion global synthetic nitrogen fertilizer market. Pivot Bio PROVEN™, the company's inaugural product for corn, consistently delivers more nitrogen into the crop than synthetic nitrogen, translating to an average of 5.8 bushels per acre advantage when compared to fields using only synthetic nitrogen in 2019.By adopting Pivot Bio's cleaner nitrogen, agriculture will simultaneously achieve more consistent yields and eliminate one gigaton of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions (akin to removing 216 million cars off the road). Additionally, water-borne nitrates will be reduced, avoiding an estimated $4.1 billion in U.S. water purification costs and significantly reducing the dead zones in our oceans. These reductions are driven by Pivot Bio helping farmers shrink their use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer by at least 100 million metric tons over the coming decade.""Growers and our planet deserve a better fertilizer - one that balances on-farm economics with the farmer's commitment to leave the land better for the next generation, and Pivot Bio's technology helps them do just that,"" said Karsten Temme, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of Pivot Bio.

Earlier this spring, the company launched its inaugural product for U.S. wheat crops, Pivot Bio RETURN™, through a limited, early-adopter program.""Pivot Bio's microbial nitrogen fertilizers are revolutionizing how farmers apply nitrogen to their crops, and we're excited to continue our investment to support this important mission,"" said Carmichael Roberts of Breakthrough Energy Ventures. ""The company is leading the charge on truly sustainable farming techniques, and we're confident that they'll continue to innovate their product offerings to solve this critical climate and societal challenge.""Manufactured, sold, and distributed to farmers in a radically different model from traditional synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, Pivot Bio's approach uses significantly less energy than the manufacturing of synthetic fertilizer, eliminates 99.5% of greenhouse gas emissions during its production, and is delivered through regular shipping carriers. This model eliminates the costly infrastructure of factories, pipelines, barges, and storage at brick-and-mortar retail locations. Instead, local trusted agronomic advisors can leverage a simplified mobile app to order and schedule on-demand delivery as they help farmers plan their nutrient management strategy.""Pivot Bio is addressing one of the most difficult challenges facing agriculture in the 21st century - reducing dependence on damaging synthetic fertilizer while increasing crop yields and creating better outcomes for farmers,"" said Matt Ocko, Managing Partner, DCVC. ""DCVC led Pivot Bio's early rounds and remains a major backer because we believe the company will truly transform global agricultural practices. We're pleased the company continues to bring its microbial nitrogen technology to new crops and new locations, across America and around the world.""""Farmer acceptance of our technology and support of our vision is far beyond our expectations,"" said Temme.
